# WMD: To Glitch

This repository contains the source files for the completed fictional story, "WMD: To Glitch," a speculative-fiction narrative exploring themes of paranoia, identity, conspiracy, and the blurred lines between reality and simulation.

- Graphic violence and gore

## Story Summary (Lore) - Spoiler Alert!
For a detailed lore summary, see [lore_summary.txt](lore_summary.txt).

### Brief Overview:
Lila, a trendy LA influencer, participates in a cutting-edge VR trial, "Life as Another," immersing herself in the life of a paranoid, conspiracy-obsessed white male. Post-trial, she discovers that alcohol triggers a violent alter ego—her "White Male Drunk" (WMD) persona—hyper-aware and convinced of a vast conspiracy. As Lila navigates her fractured reality, she uncovers a web of human trafficking, gang wars, and a mysterious hospital overrun with strange patients. Her best friend Mia, tied to the Chinese mafia, is drawn into the chaos, forcing Lila to confront her shifting identity and the dangerous forces at play.

The story escalates as Lila investigates the VR trial’s origins, battles shadowy operatives, and uncovers the truth about the trial’s creator—a developer whose mind was uploaded into the simulation, now fragmented within her as WMD. Blending psychological thriller, action, and sci-fi, the narrative probes the nature of reality, identity, and the existential risks of immersive technology. Cosmic visions, robotic ambiguities, and a high-stakes escape leave readers questioning what’s real.

## Project Status
The story is now **complete** with all three parts:
- **Part 1: The Overexposed Memory**
- **Part 2: The Echoes to Reality**
- **Part 3: Ping the Source**


The full narrative is available in the repository, compiled into a single LaTeX file for easy reading and building.
