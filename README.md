## Story Summary (Lore) - Spoiler alert!

See the full lore summary in `lore_summary.txt`.

**Brief Overview:**

Lila, a seemingly carefree LA "influencer" type, participates in a cutting-edge virtual reality trial called "Life as Another."  She chooses to experience life as a stereotypical, paranoid, conspiracy-theorist white male.  After the trial, she discovers that consuming alcohol triggers a disturbing personality shift, bringing the VR persona to the forefront.  This "White Male Drunk" (WMD) persona is hyper-aware, violent, and convinced of a vast conspiracy targeting him.  

As Lila navigates this fragmented reality, she uncovers a web of interconnected events: a sunken cargo ship linked to human trafficking, a gang war in Chinatown, and a mysterious hospital overrun with patients exhibiting strange symptoms.  Her best friend, Mia, becomes entangled in the conspiracy, forcing Lila to confront her own shifting identity and the dangerous forces at play. The story blends elements of psychological thriller, action, and science fiction, questioning the nature of reality, identity, and the potential consequences of immersive technology. Also there is possible cloning/doppelgangers that show up.
