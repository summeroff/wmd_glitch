<h1 id="the-overexposed-memory">The Overexposed Memory</h1>
<h2 id="as-usual-at-this-time">As Usual at This Time</h2>
<p>I walk by the corner store as usual at this time of day. 8:47 a.m.,
to be exact, I checked my watch twice because the second hand seemed to
stutter. <em>Or maybe it’s my eyes playing tricks again.</em> And
there’s this Jew. <em>Why he look at me like that?</em> His eyes, narrow
and sharp, like they’re peeling me open layer by layer, looking for
something I didn’t even know I hid. I scribble this down in my notebook:
black leather, 5x7, the one I keep in my left coat pocket because the
right one’s got a hole from when I snagged it on the fence last Tuesday.
The Jew’s standing there, behind the counter, polishing a glass with a
rag that’s probably dirtier than the glass itself. He’s got a name tag
<span class="nodecor">"Eli"</span>, but I bet that’s not his real name.
<em>They never use real names, do they? Too risky, too telling.</em></p>
<p>I don’t go in. Not today. I just keep walking, head down, because if
I stop, he’ll ask me something, and then I’ll have to answer, and then
he’ll know. <em>Know what? I don’t know what. But something.</em> My
shoes scuff the pavement, gray sneakers, laces fraying on the left one,
and I count the cracks in the sidewalk: one, two, three, stop at four
because four’s a bad number. <em>Too square, too even, too much like a
cage.</em> I write that down too, in case it means something later.</p>
<p>The air smells like burnt coffee and diesel, probably from the truck
idling across the street: blue cab, rust on the fender, license plate
starts with a K. <em>K for "keep watching", maybe.</em> The driver’s
slumped in the seat, cap pulled low. <em>Binoculars under there?</em> I
jot it down: <code>Truck, blue, K-plate, possible surveillance.</code>
My pen’s running low on ink; I can feel it scraping the paper instead of
gliding. Have to get a new one soon, but not from <span
class="nodecor">Eli</span>’s store. <em>He’d probably sell me one with a
chip in it, something to track my writing.</em></p>
<p>I turn left at the intersection, same as always, because routine
keeps me safe. <em>If I change it, they’ll notice.</em> Who’s "they"? I
don’t know yet. I’ll figure it out when I have more data. My notebook’s
got 73 pages filled already, single-spaced, front and back, since I
started this three months ago. October 20th, 2024, the day the
streetlight outside my apartment flickered three times instead of two.
<em>That’s when I knew something was off.</em> I wrote it down then, and
I’ve been writing ever since.</p>
<p>There’s a woman walking her dog up ahead: black mutt, scruffy,
tugging the leash. She’s in a red coat, too bright, like she wants to be
seen. I squint at her: mid-30s, maybe, hair in a bun, glasses perched on
her nose like she’s pretending to read the world. She nods at me as I
pass. <em>A nod. Why a nod?</em> I don’t know her. Never seen her
before, or have I? I flip back through my notebook: October 28th, woman
in yellow scarf, November 14th, woman with stroller, but no red coat.
<em>New player, then.</em> I write:
<code>Woman, red coat, black dog, nodded at me, 8:53 a.m.</code> The dog
barks once, sharp, like it’s signaling something. I don’t look back.
<em>Looking back shows you’re scared, and I’m not scared. I’m
aware.</em></p>
<p>The bus stop’s next. I don’t take the bus, too many eyes, too many
variables, but I pass it every day to check the schedule. It’s taped to
the pole, laminated, but the edges are curling up like it’s tired of
being there. Bus 42 is due at 8:55 a.m. Except it’s not there yet, and
it’s 8:56 now. <em>Late. Or canceled. Or rerouted to follow me.</em> I
note it: <code>Bus 42, late, possible deviation.</code> There’s a man
sitting on the bench, old, hunched, reading a newspaper. He doesn’t look
up, but I see his fingers tighten on the pages. <em>He’s pretending, I
bet.</em> I write:
<code>Old man, newspaper, tense grip, 8:56 a.m.</code></p>
<p>I keep moving. My apartment’s six blocks from here, 12 minutes if I
don’t stop, 14 if I do. I won’t stop. The wind picks up, rattling the
leaves in the gutter, and I hear a car horn two streets over, short,
sharp, like a code. <em>I don’t know the code yet, but I’ll figure it
out.</em> Everything’s a pattern if you look hard enough. My pen
scratches as I write:
<code>Horn, two streets west, single blast, 8:58 a.m.</code> The ink’s
almost gone now; I can barely read the last letters. I’ll have to switch
to pencil when I get home. <em>Pencil’s safer anyway, no ink to spill,
no evidence to leak.</em></p>
<p>I pass the alley behind the Chinese joint, and the air reeks. Trash,
or something worse. Two guys lean against the wall, hoods up, hands
buried in their pockets. One’s got a tattoo, dragon or snake, curling up
his neck like it’s alive. They don’t look at me, but I feel their eyes
anyway. <em>They’re watching, aren’t they?</em> I jot it down:
<code>Two men, alley, tattoo, 9:00 a.m. Gang vibe?</code>
<em>Maybe.</em> I’ll keep it in mind for later, when the pieces start
fitting together. <em>They will. They have to.</em></p>
<p>I walked by the next block. Bookstore was there, of course, sign all
but bleached out, windows like eyes peering out from behind a film of
dust. Always felt like they were watching you from in there. New paper
slapped on the front: ’A. Gore, climate justice.’ Words half gone, ink
bleeding like a wound down the page. Took a second to make it out.
<strong>Gore</strong> - like a twisted message just for me. Scribbled it
down: <code>Bookstore, Gore thing, pressure point?, 9:02 a.m.</code> Not
falling for it. They push, though. Always pushing. It’s that feeling
again, isn’t it? Everywhere now. In the air you breathe. Closing in. I
can feel it. I can feel it.</p>
<p>By the time I reach my building, gray brick, four stories, buzzer’s
broken again, it’s 9:10 a.m. I check the windows first. Mine’s third
floor, second from the left. Curtains are still drawn, same as I left
them, but I squint anyway. <em>Could be a shadow, could be nothing.</em>
I write: <code>Window check, no movement, 9:10 a.m.</code> The lobby
smells like mildew and stale cigarettes. Mailbox 3B, mine, has a new
scratch on it, thin, diagonal, fresh. Not there yesterday. I run my
finger over it, feel the edge. <em>Someone’s marking me.</em> I note it:
<code>Mailbox 3B, new scratch, diagonal, 9:11 a.m.</code></p>
<p>Up the stairs, elevator’s a trap, always has been, I count the steps:
28 to the third floor, same as always. Key in the lock, turn twice, push
the door slow. Inside, it’s quiet. <em>Too quiet?</em> I stand there,
listening, pen hovering over the page. The clock ticks, 9:13 a.m., and
the fridge hums low, like it’s whispering secrets. I write:
<code>Apartment entry, quiet, clock and fridge audible, 9:13 a.m.</code>
Then I check the locks again, both of them, and the chain. All secure.
For now.</p>
<p>I sit at the table, wood, scratched, wobbly leg, and flip open the
notebook to a fresh page. Pen’s dead, so I grab the pencil from the
drawer, green, sharpened yesterday. I start transcribing the day, every
detail, every thought, because if I don’t, they’ll slip away, and then
I’ll miss something. <em>Something big.</em> The Jew at the store, the
woman with the dog, the late bus, the gang, the poster, the scratched
mailbox, it’s all connected. I just haven’t cracked it yet. But I will.
I’ll write it all down, and I’ll figure it out. They can watch me all
they want, but I’m watching them too. <em>And I’ve got the proof right
here, in black ink and pencil lead, page after page after page.</em></p>
<h2 id="quieter-than-yesterday">Quieter Than Yesterday</h2>
<p>February 21, 2025. 7:32 a.m. I wake up to the sound of dripping,
slow, deliberate, like a metronome set to torment me. It’s coming from
the bathroom sink, even though I tightened the faucet last night, three
full turns with the wrench I keep under the sink. I checked it twice
before bed, noted it at 11:47 p.m.:
<code>Faucet secured, no drip, wrench back in place.</code> Now it’s
leaking again. <em>Someone’s been here.</em> I grab the notebook, black
leather, 5x7, pencil still sharp from yesterday, and write:
<code>Drip started overnight, faucet tampered, 7:32 a.m.</code> I don’t
fix it yet. I listen instead. Drip. Drip. Drip. Three seconds apart.
<em>A signal?</em> I count ten drops, then stop, because eleven’s too
complete, too final.</p>
<p>I don’t leave through the front door today. <em>Routine’s compromised
after the mailbox scratch.</em> Someone knows my path. I take the fire
escape instead, third floor, rusted rungs cold under my hands. The alley
smells like wet cardboard and something sour, maybe rotting fruit from
the dumpster. I scan the ground, cigarette butts, a candy wrapper, a
feather. <em>A feather?</em> Black, small, curved like a crow’s. I pick
it up with my sleeve, not my fingers, tuck it into my pocket.
<em>Evidence.</em> I write:
<code>Feather in alley, black, possible marker, 7:39 a.m.</code>
<em>Crows don’t just drop feathers. They’re messengers.</em> I’ll look
that up later.</p>
<p>The street’s quieter than yesterday, no truck, no dog. I head east
instead of west, toward the canal, less foot traffic, fewer eyes. My
boots crunch on gravel, brown lace-ups, scuffed toes, and I notice the
pebbles are uneven, like someone scattered them on purpose. <em>A
trail?</em> I crouch, inspect them: small, gray, some wet despite no
rain overnight. I write:
<code>Gravel by canal, wet, arranged, 7:46 a.m.</code> Then I see it, a
glint in the water, ten feet out. Metal, maybe glass, catching the sun.
I squint, but it’s too far to tell. <em>Binoculars would help, but I
don’t have them.</em> They’d have them, though. Whoever’s watching. I
note it: <code>Object in canal, reflective, 7:48 a.m.</code></p>
<p>A barge drifts by, slow, engine rumbling low like a growl. The man
steering it, bald, bearded, orange vest, stares straight ahead, but I
see his hand twitch on the wheel. <em>He’s avoiding me. Why?</em> I
don’t know him, but he knows something. I write:
<code>Barge man, orange vest, twitchy hand, 7:51 a.m.</code> The water
ripples behind him, and I count the waves, five, six, seven, before they
fade. <em>Seven’s a power number, too strong, too intentional.</em> I
don’t like it.</p>
<p>I keep walking along the canal path, concrete cracked and mossy,
until I reach the bridge. It’s old, iron, painted green but peeling in
strips like shedding skin. There’s a lock on the railing, brass, shiny,
no rust. New. I stop, stare at it. <em>No one puts a lock here.</em>
It’s not a lover’s bridge, not a tourist spot. I touch it, cold, smooth,
and feel a hum, faint, like it’s alive. My pencil scratches fast:
<code>Lock on bridge, brass, new, humming, 7:59 a.m.</code> I look
around, nobody, but the air feels thick, like it’s holding its breath.
Then I hear it: a click, sharp, from under the bridge. I freeze. Write:
<code>Click from below, source unknown, 8:00 a.m.</code></p>
<p>I don’t go under. <em>Too risky.</em> I backtrack instead, fast, past
the barge, gone now, and the glinting thing in the water, still there,
mocking me. My heart’s thumping, but I keep my steps even, four paces,
pause, four paces, pause, so they won’t know I’m rattled. In the alley,
I spot a marking on the wall, spray-painted, fresh, a half-moon with an
arrow through it. Not there yesterday. I jot it down:
<code>Wall marking, half-moon with arrow, new, 8:05 a.m.</code>
<em>Could be a tag, could be a sign.</em> I’ll check my notes later for
patterns.</p>
<p>Back in the alley, I climb the fire escape, check the feather in my
pocket, it’s still there, bent now, and slip inside. 8:14 a.m. The
drip’s stopped. <em>Stopped?</em> I run to the bathroom, stare at the
sink. Dry. Not a drop. I didn’t fix it. I write:
<code>Drip gone, unexplainable, 8:15 a.m.</code></p>
<p>Before sitting down, I glance out the kitchen window. A figure stands
across the street, half-hidden by a lamppost, tall, coat too heavy for
the weather, face shadowed. I note it quick:
<code>Figure by lamppost, heavy coat, stationary, 8:16 a.m.</code> Then
he turns, slips into the crowd, gone before I can blink. I add:
<code>Figure vanished, 8:17 a.m.</code></p>
<p>I sit at the table, wood, scratched, wobbly leg, and spread the
notebook open. The feather goes next to it, flat on the page, a dark
slash against the white. I sketch it quick, curved spine, frayed edges,
then start transcribing: the drip, the feather, the gravel, the canal
object, the barge man, the lock, the click, the wall marking, the
figure. It’s not random. It’s a sequence, a message, a map. The dripping
was a wake-up, the feather a pointer, the lock a key, literal or not,
I’ll find out. They’re closing in, tightening the net, but I’m ahead.
I’ve got the pieces, right here, in pencil and paper. I’ll decode it
before they do. I have to.</p>
<h2 id="then-a-third">Then a Third</h2>
<p>March 23, 2025. 4:17 p.m. It’s been weeks since I left the apartment,
27 days, noted on page 89:
<code>Last outing, February 24, minimal contact, safe return.</code> Too
much has piled up: the feather’s still on my table, shedding tiny barbs;
the lock’s hum echoes in my head; the drip started again three nights
ago, irregular now, like Morse code I can’t crack. <em>They’re
back.</em></p>
<p>I had to go out today, supplies low, no pencils left, only stubs too
short to grip. I take the front door this time, no fire escape, because
the alley’s too exposed. A car’s been sitting there, engine off but not
silent—radio static leaking through the cracks.. Notebook’s in my left
pocket, 5x7, pages curling at the edges from sweat and overuse. I lock
the door, twice, chain on, and step into the street.</p>
<p>The city’s wrong. It’s swollen, buzzing, loud, pre-holiday madness,
Easter or something, I don’t keep calendars anymore. People everywhere,
elbows jabbing, bags swinging, voices overlapping like static, boots
churning slush into black streaks on the pavement. I write:
<code>Crowds, holiday prep, 4:19 p.m.</code> They’ve got ribbons up, red
and yellow, strung across lampposts like nets waiting to drop. A woman
brushes past me, green scarf, jingling bracelets, muttering about eggs.
<em>Eggs?</em> I squint at her, then at the store windows: baskets,
pastel colors, fake grass. <em>It’s a distraction, a cover.</em> I note:
<code>Egg talk, possible code, 4:21 p.m.</code></p>
<p>I head for the stationery shop, three blocks north, but the street’s
clogged. A man in a rabbit costume, white, floppy ears, holding a sign,
stands by a cart, handing out candy. His eyes are hidden behind the
mask, but I feel them tracking me, mechanical, unblinking, like he’s
programmed to track. <em>Why a rabbit?</em> I write:
<code>Rabbit man, candy, observing, 4:24 p.m.</code> Kids swarm him,
laughing, sticky hands grabbing. One drops a wrapper, shiny, purple,
lands near my boot. <em>Could be laced, tagged, a plant.</em> I don’t
pick it up. I step over it, keep moving.</p>
<p>The air’s thick with cinnamon and exhaust, street vendors frying
dough, shouting prices in monotone loops. A bell rings, sharp, from a
church two streets over. Then another. Then a third. Three bells,
uneven, like that night the streetlight flickered before it all started.
I stop, pencil shaking: <code>Bells, three, staggered, 4:27 p.m.</code>
<em>A signal, a countdown.</em> My chest tightens. I push forward, past
a woman with a stroller, twins staring at me, eyes glassy and fixed, and
a guy on a phone, whispering fast. He says "package is close" twice. I
catch it, write:
<code>Man on phone, ‘package is close’ x2, 4:29 p.m.</code> <em>Package
for me? Has to be.</em></p>
<p>The stationery shop’s ahead, but the crowd’s a wall now, shoulders,
hats, a sea of breath fogging the air. A horn blares, delivery truck,
white, no markings, cuts me off. The driver leans out, yells something I
don’t catch. His cap’s pulled low, like the truck guy from February, but
no K-plate this time. I write:
<code>Truck, white, no plate visible, aggressive, 4:32 p.m.</code> The
crowd shifts, shoves me sideways, notebook nearly slipping from my
pocket. I clutch it, heart hammering. <em>They’re herding me.</em></p>
<p>I turn back, home’s safer than this, but the street’s a maze now.
Lights flicker on, strings of bulbs dangling over doorways, blinking in
patterns I can’t read. A carol starts, tinny, off-key, piped through
speakers I didn’t see before. I write:
<code>Lights blinking, carol, unnatural, 4:35 p.m.</code> A kid runs
past, balloon tied to his wrist, red, bobbing like a flare. It pops,
loud, and I flinch. Laughter ripples from behind, sharp, familiar. I
spin, but faces blur, too many, too close. My pencil scratches:
<code>Balloon pop, laughter, targeted?, 4:37 p.m.</code></p>
<p>I’m two blocks from home, but it’s slow, every step’s a fight. A
woman drops a bag of groceries, oranges roll, one hits my foot. I kick
it away, hard. She glares, mutters something foreign, maybe "your fault"
or "white trash". <em>Intentional? Did she mean me?</em> I write:
<code>Orange drop, intentional, foreign words, 4:40 p.m.</code> The
bells ring again, four this time. Four. I hate four. My head’s pounding,
sweat stinging my eyes. The rabbit man’s back, or another one, same
costume, ten feet away now, still as a mannequin, staring. I write:
<code>Rabbit man again, closer, stationary, 4:42 p.m.</code></p>
<p>One block left. The crowd thins, but the air’s heavier, smoke, maybe
something chemical. A drone hums overhead, small, black, hovering right
above me, then darting off between buildings. I freeze, watch it vanish.
I write: <code>Drone, black, circling, 4:44 p.m.</code> <em>They’ve
escalated.</em> My legs shake, but I force them forward. Home’s in
sight, gray brick, four stories, but the windows glow, all of them, even
mine, curtains twitching like someone’s there. I didn’t leave lights on.
I write: <code>Windows lit, intrusion, 4:46 p.m.</code></p>
<p>The pencil snaps, lead breaks clean off, rolling under my boot. I
fumble for another stub, hands trembling, but a loud crack splits the
air. Not a balloon, not a horn, louder, deeper, like the earth
splitting. I drop the notebook, clap my hands over my ears, and
everything slows: the crowd freezes, faces turn, the rabbit man tilts
his head. My vision blurs, white, then black, and I’m falling, knees
hitting pavement, notebook splayed open beside me, pages flapping like
wings. Then nothing.</p>
<h2 id="like-mine-but-torn">Like Mine but Torn</h2>
<p>March 23, 2025. Time unknown. I wake up, head throbbing like a drum,
lights too bright, white, buzzing, stabbing my eyes. I’m on a bed, stiff
sheets, metal rails. Hospital. <em>How?</em> Last thing, notebook
falling, crack splitting the air, pavement. I sit up fast, hands patting
my coat, left pocket empty. Notebook’s gone. My chest tightens, breath
short. <em>They took it.</em> The Jew from the corner store, the rabbit
man, the drone, someone. I scan the room: pale walls, a tray with a cup,
a window too high to reach. No clock, but the light’s dim outside, dusk
maybe. <em>I need to write. I need it back.</em></p>
<p>I swing my legs off the bed, bare feet, cold tile, and check the
bedside table: drawer’s empty, just dust and a bent paperclip. No
notebook. My coat’s on a hook, gray, sleeve torn from the fall, but the
pocket’s flat, searched. I dig anyway: lint, the feather’s barb, no 5x7
leather. <em>Stolen. Evidence gone.</em> My hands shake, but I spot a
red marker on the tray, cap scratched, and rolls of gauze stacked beside
it, white, coiled, clean enough. I grab both, tear a strip of gauze, and
scribble:
<code>Woke in hospital, notebook missing, dusk?, red log started.</code>
I wrap the gauze around my arms, chest, legs, words pressed under my
coat, a full-body record, ink bleeding faintly through. <em>It’s messy,
strange, but it’ll do.</em></p>
<p>Voices outside, low, muffled, shuffling feet. I crack the door,
hallway, fluorescent flicker, a nurse at a desk, head down. She’s pale,
fingers drumming slow, uneven, like she’s stuck in a pattern. I note it
on the gauze, twisting my wrist to write:
<code>Nurse, pale, odd rhythm, time unknown.</code> I need out. Home’s
safer, gray brick, locks I trust. I slip into the hall, barefoot, coat
pulled tight, red marker tucked in my fist. Signs point left: Elevator,
Floors 1-3. Right: Stairs, Floors 1-6. I’m on 4, farthest from the exit.
<em>Planned, probably.</em> I choose stairs; <em>elevators trap you,
always have.</em></p>
<p>Floor 4’s quiet, too quiet. A janitor mops ahead, slow, head tilted,
dragging the handle like it weighs a ton. His eyes don’t lift, but his
jaw’s slack, lips wet. I write:
<code>Janitor, slow, slack face, Floor 4.</code> I edge past, back to
the wall, down the stairwell. Concrete’s cold, steps echo soft. A light
buzzes, stutters, off, on, off. I note:
<code>Light flicker, Floor 4 stairs.</code> Halfway down, a man ascends,
suit, tie loose, swaying like he’s drunk. He grunts, low, guttural, like
something’s stuck in his throat. I freeze, then sidestep. His hand
brushes the rail, nails cracked, skin grayish. I write:
<code>Man, gray skin, grunt, Floor 3 stairs.</code> <em>Something’s off,
but I keep moving.</em></p>
<p>Floor 3’s busier, patients shuffling, a doctor with a clipboard, all
slow, like they’re underwater. The doctor’s head jerks, sharp, then
still, eyes locked ahead too long. I write:
<code>Doctor, twitch, Floor 3.</code> Air’s thicker here, sour, like
meat left out, clogging my nose. I pull my collar up, breathe shallow.
Exit’s two floors down, but the stairwell’s blocked, a cart, tipped,
sheets spilled. I duck into a hall instead, past a woman in a gown,
staring at nothing, drooling thin. I write:
<code>Woman, drool, blank eyes, Floor 3.</code> My gauze is crowded; I
tear another strip, wrap it a second layer:
<code>Continued log, Floor 3, air sour.</code></p>
<p>A supply closet’s ahead, door ajar, dark inside. I slip in, find a
shovel, wood handle, rusted blade, propped against a shelf. Heavy, but
mine now. I note: <code>Shovel acquired, Floor 3 closet.</code> Back in
the hall, the doctor’s closer, clipboard dangling, mouth open wider than
before. Teeth yellow, jagged. I dodge left, toward the stairs again.
Floor 2 now, lights dimmer, a nurse stumbles past, arm dangling, skin
peeling at the elbow, her steps too even, like she’s coded to roam. I
write: <code>Nurse, peeling, Floor 2.</code> <em>Dots connect slow,
pale, slack, gray, drool.</em> Escape first.</p>
<p>Stairs to Floor 1, almost there. A man blocks the landing, big,
orderly maybe, swaying, eyes milky. He moans, soft, then loud. I grip
the shovel, write: <code>Man, milky eyes, moan, Floor 2 landing.</code>
He lunges, slow, clumsy, but I swing anyway, instinct kicking in. The
blade cracks his skull, wet crunch, and he drops, twitching once. I
stare, blood black, thick, not right, like the gore filter in a game.
Then it hits: not human, not anymore. <em>Zombies. All of them.</em> I
write, hands shaking:
<code>Orderly, zombie, killed, Floor 2, shovel hit.</code> No time left,
exit’s close, but they’ve seen me now.</p>
<h2 id="buzzer-still-broken">Buzzer Still Broken</h2>
<p>March 23, 2025. Time still unknown, dusk fading. I’m out, hospital
doors behind me, glass shattered, no alarm. Shovel in hand, blade sticky
with black blood from the orderly. Floor 1 was a blur, two more came at
me, a patient with one arm dangling, a guard with half his face gone. I
swung twice: first hit cracked the patient’s jaw, second split the
guard’s neck. They dropped, gurgling, not human anymore. I wrote it fast
on the gauze, wrist cramped:
<code>Patient, one arm, killed, Floor 1 / Guard, half face, killed, Floor 1, shovel hits.</code>
No time to think, exit was there, and I took it.</p>
<p>Outside’s worse. The city’s dead but moving. Holiday lights blink,
red, yellow, some smashed, casting shadows that twitch. Cinnamon’s gone;
air’s rot now, thick, wet. I crouch behind a dumpster, green, dented,
leaking something dark, and scan: street’s empty, then not. Shapes
shamble, three, maybe four, near the vendor carts, dough cold, flies
buzzing. I tear more gauze, wrap it higher on my arm:
<code>Escaped hospital, city rotting, 3-4 figures, dusk.</code> Shovel’s
heavy, but I grip it tighter. Home’s six blocks south, gray brick, my
locks, safe if I make it.</p>
<p>I move, low, along the alley, wet cardboard underfoot, quieter than
pavement. A moan cuts through, left side. I freeze. It’s the rabbit man,
costume torn, one ear missing, candy scattered around him. His mask’s
off, face gray, eyes sunken, mouth dripping. He lurches, slow, but
toward me. No choice. I swing, shovel catches his temple, skull caves
in, he flops like a puppet cut loose. I write:
<code>Rabbit man, zombie, killed, alley, shovel hit.</code> Black blood
splatters my coat, sleeve now. I wipe it on the wall, keep going.</p>
<p>Two blocks down, hiding’s harder. Street’s wider, lights flicker
worse, on, off, on, like a signal I can’t read. A car’s stalled, door
open, driver slumped over the wheel. She twitches, head snapping up as I
pass, hair matted, teeth bared. I don’t wait. Shovel arcs down, cracks
her crown, she slumps again, still. I record it, gauze tight against my
skin: <code>Driver, female, zombie, killed, street, shovel hit.</code>
My arm aches, but I write it. Two kills now outside, four total.
<em>Patterns matter.</em></p>
<p>Block four, I duck into a shop, stationery, irony not lost. Shelves
tipped, pens spilled, no notebooks. A shuffle from the back, clerk,
glasses cracked, dragging a leg. He groans, louder when he sees me. I
sidestep, swing low, shovel takes his knee, then up to his head. He
crumples, glasses skittering. Scribble:
<code>Clerk, zombie, killed, shop, shovel x2.</code> I grab a pencil,
red, unsharpened, from the floor, shove it in my pocket. No time for
more, moans echo outside, closer.</p>
<p>Last two blocks, I stick to shadows. Holiday ribbons hang limp,
shredded, some stained dark. A kid’s balloon, red, deflated, rolls past,
carried by wind that smells like death. I hear shuffling, too many feet,
but I’m near, gray brick in sight, four stories, my window dark.
Relief’s cut short, a figure staggers from the stoop, big, coat like
mine but torn, maybe the guy I glimpsed near the mailboxes weeks ago,
always lurking near the mailboxes. Neighbor, maybe, or was. He turns,
eyes white, jaw unhinged, and lunges. I swing hard, shovel bites his
neck, nearly severs it. He falls, wet thud. I write:
<code>Neighbor?, zombie, killed, stoop, shovel hit.</code></p>
<p>I stumble to the door, buzzer still broken, good sign, and fumble the
key. Inside, up the stairs, 28 steps, counting keeps me sane, I lock
myself in: deadbolt, chain. Apartment’s untouched, table scratched,
feather still there, drip silent now. I collapse, shovel clattering, and
unwrap the gauze:
<code>Home, 5 kills total, city overrun, time unknown.</code> Red ink’s
smeared into my skin, lines of words bleeding under the surface, like
the notes are part of me now. I pull out the pencil, I sharpen it with a
knife, slow, deliberate. They’re out there, shuffling, but I’m here. For
now.</p>
<h2 id="symbols-staring-back">Symbols Staring Back</h2>
<p>March 24, 2025. Time unknown. I wake, curtains drawn, feather on the
table, shovel by the door, then a crash. Door splinters, wood flies, and
the back of a police shotgun swings at my face. Black steel, barrel
scratched, too fast to dodge. It hits, cheekbone cracks, I’m down,
sprawled on the floor, blood hot in my mouth. No gauze, no pencil, hands
empty, coat torn off me in the fall. Can’t write. I scream instead,
notes to the universe: <code>SHOTGUN—POLICE—BROKE IN—FACE HIT—</code>
Voice raw, echoing off walls. They’re here, finally, masks off.</p>
<p>Boots stomp, two, three pairs?, and I analyze: heavy tread,
deliberate, not zombie-shuffle. A voice barks, <em>Stay down!</em>,
male, clipped, no accent I can place. I squint through swelling eyes:
uniforms, badges glint, but faces blur. Another hit, butt of the gun,
temple this time, stars burst, I scream:
<code>SECOND HIT—TEMPAL—BADGES—</code> Pain’s a wave, drowning me, but I
keep tracking: blood pools under my jaw, warm, sticky; floor’s cold,
scuffed, same scratches from yesterday. Third hit, ribs, I curl, scream:
<code>RIBS—THIRD—COUNTING—</code> Then black swallows me, no edges,
gone.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="hospital-again">Hospital again</h4>
<p>Time unknown again. Eyes flutter, hospital again, different. Bed’s
hard, wrists wired to rails, tight, cutting skin. I jerk, but no give.
Room’s dim, machines beep, slow, off-rhythm. Figures around me, white
coats, zombie doctors, gray skin peeling, eyes dull like the clerk’s.
One leans close, teeth jagged, breath like rot. I thrash, wires bite
deeper, scream: <code>ZOMBIE DOCTORS—WIRED—TRAPPED—</code> No shovel, no
out. They don’t flinch, just shuffle, hands steady. One holds a syringe,
clear liquid, needle glints. I twist, scream:
<code>SYRINGE—INJECTION—NO—</code> It pierces my arm, cold floods in,
vision warps, edges soften, gray fades.</p>
<p>Blink. Normal hospital now, white walls, antiseptic sting, no rot.
I’m bandaged, arms, chest, gauze thick with symbols: circles, slashes,
scribbles I don’t know. Doctors human again, masked, moving fast. A
monitor blinks, heart rate spiking. I try to scream, notes, anything,
but throat’s dry, voice cracks to nothing. <em>Injection’s working, head
swims, lights pulse, too bright, too real.</em> Consciousness slips, a
slow fade, out.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="concrete-walls">Concrete walls</h4>
<p>Time unknown, third wake. Concrete walls, no windows, bars enclose
the prison cell. I’m slumped on a cot, bandaged, , symbols staring back,
etched into the gauze, circles, slashes, scribbles I can’t decipher,
faint under the dim light. My wrists are free, but my hands tremble, no
pencil, no gauze, nothing to write with, just the itch of the fabric
against my skin. A man sits across, pastor, black robe draped loose,
beard patchy, eyes fixed on me, unblinking, steady as if measuring
something beneath my flesh. He leans forward, voice low, deliberate, a
mix of English and Slavic church tones: <em>My child, pokoj be yours,
peace in soul. What do you see when you close your eyes?</em> His words
roll slow, heavy, like he’s tuning me, fishing for a signal. <em>I don’t
trust it, too precise, too probing.</em> I yell notes into the void:
<code>PASTOR—PEACE—SEE—CELL—</code></p>
<p>He nods, slight, measured, hands folded in his lap. <em>Good, ditko,
little one. Slava shines, glory of light. What do you hear in this
tishina, this silence?</em> His tone’s calm, a cadence like he’s
reciting lines, waiting for me to echo back, to give him something
useful. My chest tightens. <em>He’s digging, calibrating, not
praying.</em> I scream, repeating his bait:
<code>GLORY—SILENCE—HEAR—</code> He tilts his head, eyes narrowing just
a fraction, voice steady: <em>Yes, molitva, prayer rises. Tell me, what
burns in your heart, ohn?</em> His mix of words, half sermon, half
Slavic chant, feels like he’s syncing me, pulling data from my
bones.</p>
<p><em>Suspicion creeps in, why’s he asking? What’s he after?</em> I
scream louder, notes twisting: <code>PRAYER—FIRE—WHAT—</code> He shifts,
robe rustling, voice edging up: <em>Speak, brat, brother! Bezpeka v
dushi, safety in soul, where is it?</em> His calm frays, hands unclasp,
fingers twitch like he’s losing a signal. I scream back, defiance
rising: <code>SAFETY—WHERE—TRICK—</code> His face hardens, eyes glint
sharp, and he leans closer, breath sour: <em>Hovory pravdu, speak truth!
Slid grixa, trace of sin, show me!</em> The church mask slips, urgency
breaking through, spit flecking his lips.</p>
<p>I catch it. <em>He’s not saving me, he’s mining me.</em> My gut
twists, paranoia flares. I scream: <code>TRUTH—SIN—LIE—</code> He jolts
up, robe flapping, voice spiking: <em>Proklyattya tebe, curse on you!
Zhertva, victim, why hide?</em> His hands curl, spit sprays my bandages,
calm gone to rage. I match him: <code>CURSE—VICTIM—HIDING—</code> He’s
shouting now, full tilt: <em>Pokara! Zlo v tobi, evil in you! Krivda,
falsehood!</em>, beard quivering, robe tearing at the hem as he lurches.
I scream: <code>PUNISH—EVIL—FALSE—</code></p>
<p>We’re locked in it, voices crashing. He bellows: <em>Slava rozbiy,
glory breaks! Chort tebe, devil take you!</em>, spit lands on my arm,
hands flail like he’s clawing out answers. I scream back:
<code>GLORY—DEVIL—TAKE—</code> He presses on, wild: <em>Molitva pade,
prayer falls! Pokay, repent now!</em>, his eyes burn, robe frays, words
tangle into a snarl. I scream: <code>PRAYER—REPENT—NO—</code> It’s a
storm, no sense, just noise piling up, his fingers twist, spit stains my
cot, beard shakes like static. My head pounds, symbols pulse on the
bandages, or I imagine they do, no telling anymore. No escape, no
record, just this, shouting into a void that shouts back, louder,
madder, endless.</p>
<h2 id="stole-my-ramen">Stole My Ramen</h2>
<p>April 2, 2025. 6a.m., I think. Time’s slippery here, cell’s got no
clock, just a slit window too high to see sun or stars. Woke on the cot
again, concrete biting through the thin mattress, bandages still on,
symbols faded but there. Been days since the pastor, his Slavic yells
echoing in my skull. Counted three so far, three meals of gray mush,
watery and cold, three nights of no sleep no reality either, just
staring at the ceiling, tracing cracks like code. Hands stopped shaking
yesterday, but the need to write clawed at me. Screaming isn’t enough. I
yell notes to the universe: <code>WORDS NEED PAPER—ORDER—PROOF</code>
Voice hoarse, bouncing off walls, useless without ink. I trace the
cracks again, seventeen jagged lines, and scream:
<code>CRACKS—CODE—WATCHING</code> No one answers, just silence and the
pastor’s gibberish looping in my head.</p>
<p>Third day, guard bangs the bars, grunts <em>Library</em>. No cuffs,
no shove, just a nod. <em>Suspicious.</em> Down the hall, gray, peeling
paint, lights buzzing, I find it: shelves sparse, books torn, but a
notebook sits on a table, blue, spiral-bound, 8x10, bigger than my old
5x7, pen clipped to it, tip dulled. No one else here, just dust and
silence. Took it, no questions, mine now. First entry, scrawled fast:
<code>Prison library, day 3, blue notebook acquired, 10:22 a.m.</code>
Felt like breathing again, pen on paper, control back. Flash of the 5x7
slipping from my pocket on that cracked pavement stings, but this’ll
do.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="death-row">Death row</h4>
<p>Back in my cell, I start catching up, days blurred, but memory’s
sharp when it matters.I write
<code>Day 1: Pastor, Slavic gibberish, ‘proklyattya,’ screaming duel, no escape. Day 2: Silence, no visitors, mush at noon, cracks in ceiling = 17, possible pattern. Day 3: Library, notebook, this.</code>
Then a clank, door unlocks, loud, metal grinding. I freeze, pen
mid-word. No guard, no voice, just open. <em>A test?</em> New note:
<code>Cell door unlocked, no cause, 11:07 a.m.</code> Shove the notebook
in my waistband, bandages itch under it, and step out.</p>
<p>Hallway’s dim, flickering bulbs, air stale with sweat and rust. Doors
line both sides, cells, bars rusted, faces behind them. First one: thin
guy, sunken cheeks, staring. I squint, familiar, too familiar. High
school, 10th grade, Tim Grayson, pale kid, always doodling skulls in
math. He’d smirk at me when I got answers wrong. Now he’s here, eyes
locked on mine, no smirk, just hollow. I write:
<code>Cell 1, Tim Grayson, school, staring, 11:09 a.m.</code> Next cell:
woman, curly hair, mid-20s. University, Lena from psych class, argued
Freud was a fraud. She’d tap her pen like a drum, drove me nuts. Now
she’s silent, head tilted, watching.
<code>Cell 2, Lena, uni psych, still, 11:10 a.m.</code></p>
<p>Doors keep opening ahead, closing behind, clang, clang, like a
machine knows I’m coming. No guards, no sound but my steps and the
locks. Third cell: bald guy, glasses smudged. Job at the AI startup,
Mark, coder, obsessed with neural nets, scoffed at my data entry gig.
He’s gripping the bars, knuckles white, staring through me. Write:
<code>Cell 3, Mark, AI startup, tense, 11:12 a.m.</code> My pulse
quickens, past’s piling up, faces I buried. Fourth cell: big guy, beard,
wild hair. World of Warcraft, clan master, ThrummSkull, led our guild,
yelled at me for missing raids. He’s pacing now, muttering, eyes
flicking to me. Note:
<code>Cell 4, ThrummSkull, WoW, pacing, 11:14 a.m.</code></p>
<p>I stop, notebook out, pen flying, connections forming, too neat, too
wrong. School, uni, job, game, timeline of me, locked here. Fifth cell:
old woman, hunched, knitting something gray. Mrs. Carter, 7th-grade
teacher, caught me writing notes once, called it "peculiar". She looks
up, needles still, mouth a thin line.
<code>Cell 5, Mrs. Carter, 7th grade, knitting, 11:16 a.m.</code> Sixth:
skinny kid, acne scars, Jake, dorm roommate, stole my ramen, laughed it
off. He rocks back and forth, staring. I wrote
<code>Cell 6, Jake, uni dorm, rocking, 11:17 a.m.</code></p>
<p>Doors keep going, open, close, open, close, leading me deeper, past
more cells. Seventh: suit, slick hair, boss at the startup, fired me for
"overanalyzing" He’s leaning on the bars, smirking like before. I write
<code>Cell 7, Boss, startup, smirking, 11:19 a.m.</code> Eighth: girl,
blonde, chewing gum, Sarah, high school crush, never saw me. Now she
does, eyes wide, gum still. I note
<code>Cell 8, Sarah, school, staring, 11:20 a.m.</code> Ninth: wiry guy,
tattoos, RazorEdge, WoW rival, trashed me in PvP. He’s clawing the air,
growling low. Saved:
<code>Cell 9, RazorEdge, WoW, hostile, 11:22 a.m.</code></p>
<p>Ten cells, then twenty, I lose count, notebook filling fast. Faces
blend, classmates, coworkers, guildmates, some I barely recall, like the
janitor from uni who whistled off-key, now whistling again behind bars.
I write <code>Cell 14, Janitor, uni, whistling, 11:25 a.m.</code> Every
door opens before I reach it, closes after, herding me. A guard finally,
end of the hall, faceless in shadow, points right. I turn, no choice,
noting: <code>Guard, shadow, directed right, 11:29 a.m.</code></p>
<p>New hall, more cells. A professor, Dr. Kline, AI ethics, droned about
sentience, sits cross-legged, stare cold like he’s running numbers on
me. I write <code>Cell 21, Dr. Kline, uni, calm, 11:31 a.m.</code> Next,
a kid from middle school, Bobby, threw my backpack in a dumpster, now
clawing at his bars.
<code>Cell 22, Bobby, school, frantic, 11:32 a.m.</code> Then, chill
down my spine, Eli, the Jew from the corner store, polishing a
nonexistent glass, clink faint, same narrow eyes. He nods, slow, like he
knows. I write it twice:
<code>Cell 23, Eli, store, polishing, 11:34 a.m.</code>
<code>Eli, here, knows.</code></p>
<p>Pages flip, half the notebook’s gone now, ink smudging from sweat.
Faces pile up: a WoW healer who ghosted us, a startup intern who spilled
coffee on my desk, a teacher who failed me in history. I scribble
<code>Cell 27, Healer, WoW, blank / Cell 28, Intern, startup, twitchy / Cell 29, Mr. Hayes, school, stern, 11:39 a.m.</code>
Doors keep moving, open, close, like a pulse, guiding me nowhere. Last
cell I note: woman with the red coat, black dog, nodded at me months
ago, now stroking the air where the dog should be.
<code>Cell 35, Red Coat, dogless, stroking, 11:45 a.m.</code></p>
<p>I stop, breathless, notebook trembling. Every face, past, present,
locked here, watching me. <em>A puzzle, a trap, a mirror.</em> Why? Who?
Doors clang shut behind, no guard now, just silence and eyes. I write:
<code>Faces from life, all cells, connected?, 11:47 a.m.</code> No
answers, just the weight of it all, pressing in.</p>
<h2 id="your-decadence-birthed">Your Decadence Birthed</h2>
<p>April 2, 2025. Time unknown, irrelevant now. I wake strapped, arms,
legs, chest, leather biting skin, the cold slab searing my spine. Wires
hum beneath me, pulsing with menace. No notebook, no gauze, hands
pinned, can’t write, can’t grip. Panic claws my gut. I scream, throat
raw: <code>STRAPS—WIRES—TRAPPED—</code> Head jerks, eyes dart, room’s
dim, circular, walls curving in, a theater of judgment. Faces in the
stands, not shadows, not zombies, famous, impossible faces, staring
down, judging me, condemning, one guy, white, straight, alone.</p>
<p>Barack Obama emerges, voice smooth but laced with venom: <em>Your
silence didn’t just mute my vision, it crushed a generation’s dreams
beneath your cowardice.</em></p>
<p>I thrash against the bonds, voice cracking. <em>I didn’t mean to let
you down. I was drowning, searching for solid ground.</em> My words
hang, pathetic, as his gaze cuts through me, unyielding.</p>
<p>Kamala Harris strides in, heels cracking like thunder, words slicing:
<em>Your privilege wasn’t just a shield, it was the lock on my cage,
your indifference the chain on my rebellion.</em> My mind splinters. I
yell, desperate: <em>I didn’t cage you! Look at me, I’m the one trapped
here!</em> Rage boils, chest ablaze.</p>
<p>Laverne Cox steps forward, fierce and unapologetic, voice a blade:
<em>Your apathy propped up their rigid world, man, woman, nothing else,
and left me invisible, erased by your quiet complicity.</em> I choke
out, <em>I, I didn’t erase you!</em> Her stare doesn’t waver, my defense
crumbling.</p>
<p>Joaquin Phoenix charges, wild-eyed, dreadlocks flailing, voice a
guttural roar: <em>You fed on their lives, raised them, loved them, then
slit their throats. Tell me, would you butcher your own dog for a meal?
Could you watch it bleed out and call it necessity?</em></p>
<p>His words slam into me, like a sledgehammer cracking open something
raw and jagged. My chest tightens, and suddenly I’m not here. I’m eight
again, barefoot on the farm, the earth warm and gritty under my soles.
Rusty’s at my side, my shaggy mutt with his lopsided grin, tongue
flapping as he chases the sun across the yard. The chickens cluck and
scatter, a flurry of feathers glinting gold as I toss grain from a
dented tin bucket, their tiny beaks tapping the dirt. Dad’s off-key
whistle floats from the tractor, a tuneless thread stitching the morning
together, steady as the thrum of his engine. Mom’s voice drifts out too,
a soft hum curling around the snap of wet sheets on the line, their
clean cotton scent mingling with hay and manure. The pigs are nosing my
hands now, their bristly snouts damp and insistent, snuffling for
scraps. I laugh, a high, bright sound swallowed by the vastness of the
day. The barn looms behind us, its red paint chipped but proud, a
fortress of warmth and safety. Then the air splits: <em>Fire! Fire!
Fire!</em> A wall of heat slams me back. Smoke claws down my throat,
thick and acrid, stinging my eyes as the fields erupt in orange and
black. The animals scream, pigs thrashing, chickens flapping uselessly,
Rusty’s bark choking into a whimper. Flames lick up the barn’s walls,
devouring it plank by plank. I reach for him, for anything, but my hands
grasp only ash. Everything collapses inward, swallowed by a roaring
void. All black.</p>
<p>The memory doesn’t fade, it fractures. A jolt rips through me, straps
biting into my wrists and chest, pinning me to cold metal. My pulse
hammers, sweat stings my eyes, and the farm’s smoke lingers in my
nostrils, a ghost I can’t shake. Voices bleed in, sharp and accusing,
pulling me back to the now. Greta Thunberg’s glare pierces through the
haze, her words slicing like a blade: <em>…all Burn. Your greed lit the
match, your waste turned my future to ash!</em> I try to scream, but my
throat locks, the sound trapped—a silent, endless howl:
<code>FIRE—ALWAYS—FIRE—</code></p>
<p>They keep coming. Harry Reid: <em>Your stillness choked my
voice.</em> Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: <em>Your hoarded excess starved my
streets.</em> Their accusations pile on, relentless. I’m breaking,
throat locked, screams trapped: <code>WHY—ME—TOO—MUCH—</code> I’m
unraveling, pleading for it to stop.</p>
<p>Silence crashes down, heavy, suffocating. A figure moves, hooded,
white, KKK robe, slow steps from the shadows, a mechanical whir beneath.
It stops at a switch. Wires spit sparks. I rasp, <em>Who are you?</em>
No one speaks, just stares. I scream: <code>KKK—SWITCH—HERE—</code> The
figure turns. Eyes blaze from the hood. He grips the lever, hesitates. A
low rumble builds in the walls, the air thickens with static. My chest
tightens, breath shallow, as shadows shift in the stands. Are they
moving closer? The hum crescendos, a promise of something vast and
unescapable. Figure’s hand hovers, gloved, a metallic glint peeking from
the sleeve, steady or trembling, I can’t tell. The lever still unpulled.
Voices gone, just the hum, my breath, their eyes, rigged, waiting.
Sparks flare brighter, a storm brews unseen, and I’m left hanging on the
edge, unmoored, waiting for the fall.</p>
<h2 id="crisp-local-ipas">Crisp, Local IPAs</h2>
<p>April 2, 2025. End is near. Sparks crackle, electricity bites, slow,
not instant like they say. Chair hums, wires spit blue, burning my
wrists, leather straps sizzling. Process drags. <em>Why?</em> Long
enough to think, to scream final notes into the void:
<code>SPARKS—SLOW—CHAIR—BURNS—</code> Obama’s eyes widen, Greta
flinches, MLK grips the rail, Xi’s stone-still. The KKK figure pulls the
switch harder, current surges, my teeth rattle, I scream:
<code>SURGE—TEETH—FINAL—</code> Vision blurs, white, black, screen cuts
in.</p>
<p>Words fade onto the screen: <strong>Simulation Terminated. Thank you
for experiencing ‘Life as Another: Virtual Identity Trial.’ Exit
Menu.</strong></p>
<p>A soft hum fades. Lila blinks, eyes adjusting, 22, golden hair
tumbling over her shoulders as she slips off the sleek silver VR helmet,
wires snaking to the sleep-pod by her bed. Her room glows pastel pink
and white, LA sun spilling through gauzy curtains, a neon <strong>Good
Vibes</strong> sign buzzing over a shelf of succulents. She stretches, a
sleepy grin curling her lips, and chirps, <em>Okay, who’d pick being a
white dude? That was wild.</em> Her voice is light, bubbly, a little
smug, she’d chosen the "realistic-identity" trial for the thrill.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="kill-to-try-that">Kill to try that</h4>
<p>April 2, 2025. Morning. It’s Friday, and Lila’s day blooms like an
Insta reel. She hops out of bed, bare feet kissing polished hardwood,
and glides to her closet: a flowy sundress, cream with tiny daisies,
layered with dainty gold necklaces and chunky tan sandals. Breakfast is
smashed avocado on artisanal sourdough, chili flakes dusting it like red
confetti, paired with a latte she foams herself, oat milk swirling into
a heart, humming Taylor Swift’s latest. She spritzes rosewater mist over
her face, cheeks glowing, and twirls in the mirror: tan skin, green eyes
sparkling, a total vibe. She admires how the sunlight catches her tan
skin, making it glow, and thinks - <em>Looking this good should be
illegal</em>. A quick smirk, her beauty has always opened doors, snagged
free drinks, turned heads. But today, it feels like armor, a shield
against whatever weirdness the VR trial left behind. She snaps a mirror
selfie, captioning it - <em>"golden hour glow"</em> for Insta. Grabs her
"Be Kind" canvas tote, lip gloss, reusable straw, a peony petal peeking
out, and floats out, LA humming soft around her.</p>
<p>Santa Monica’s alive, ocean air brushing Lila’s cheeks as she strolls
the pier. Waves lap gentle against the pilings, seagulls swoop overhead,
and she snaps pics: ferris wheel spinning against a sherbet sky, her
giggling with a strawberry ice cream cone, pink sweetness dripping down
a golden waffle edge, fingers sticky with summer vibes. Lunch is at a
vegan café with Mia, her bestie, a quinoa bowl bursting with roasted
beets, kale ribbons, and a glossy tahini drizzle, paired with iced
hibiscus tea, ruby-red in a mason jar, condensation beading like jewels.
Over their quinoa bowls, Mia leans back, eyeing Lila’s effortlessly
tousled hair. <em>God, you always look like you stepped out of a
magazine. It’s unfair!</em> Lila laughs, waving it off. <em>Says the
girl who could model for anything like a runway star. You’re stunning,
babe</em> Mia rolls eyes, but her smile widens, she knows her sleek
black hair and sharp cheekbones turn heads, even if she plays it down.
Their beauty is a shared language, a quiet confidence between them.
<em>That VR thing was insane</em>, Lila giggles, tossing her hair. <em>I
was this basic white guy, all conspiracies nonstop. Total rush.</em>
Mia, sleek black hair flipping with Shanghai flair, leans in, eyes
bright. <em>Whoa, I’d kill to try that, swap lives for a day? Sign me
up.</em> She smirks, twirling her straw. <em>Reminds me of Lunar New
Year, when I went home to Shanghai with my parents. You were obsessed
with those silk qipaos at the party, red, gold dragons snaking down ‘em.
I could’ve grabbed one for you, but you didn’t say, and now I’m stuck
here ‘cause Mom and Dad’s latest blowout has all my flights on hold.
They dragged me there for some family business mess, won’t spill
what.</em> Lila pouts, <em>Ugh, next time, babe, maybe I go with
you</em> and they sip smoothies, mango-passionfruit swirls, chia
speckling the top like tiny stars, swapping ideas for a glowy night of
palo santo and rooftop tarot under the LA stars.</p>
<p>Afternoon’s a dreamy whirl. She browses a boutique for rose quartz
earrings, teardrop gems catching the light, then hits the farmer’s
market: lavender soap bars stacked like lilac bricks, a bouquet of
peonies, pink and plush, spilling over her arm. At a rooftop juice bar
with Mia, they scoop acai bowls, purple swirls crowned with edible
pansies, scrolling Insta for crystal meditation ideas, laughing about
Mia’s <em>"parental chaos she won’t spill"</em> Lila texts Ethan her
date, tall, surfer vibes, dimples deep, confirming 7 p.m. at a rooftop
bar downtown. Back home, she curls her hair into loose waves, slips into
a sage-green dress that hugs her curves just right, and dots vanilla
perfume behind her ears, a sweet cloud trailing her. Mirror winks back:
radiant, LA’s golden girl, living her sweetest frame.</p>
<p>Sun dips low as she arrives, rooftop strung with fairy lights, music
pulsing soft, skyline glittering like a filter. Ethan’s there. When
Ethan greets her, his <em>Hey, you look amazing</em> isn’t just polite,
it’s laced with a stare that lingers a beat too long on her curves, her
glossed lips. Lila’s used to it, the way her beauty pulls focus, but
something about his gaze feels off, like he’s scanning her, not just
admiring. She brushes it aside, chalking it up to nerves, but the unease
sticks. They order beers, crisp local IPAs, amber glowing in frosted
glasses, and clink, giggling over his surf wipeout tale. He adjusts his
ear once, odd for a sec, then grins again. She takes a sip, cool and
bitter, then a slow gulp, then a bigger one.</p>
<p>A chill creeps in, world tilts. Eyes narrow, she scans: music’s
off-key, lights flicker wrong, Ethan’s grin too stiff. <em>Somethin’s
not right</em> - she mutters under her breath. Far end of the bar, the
bartender, dark hair, narrow eyes from somewhere, polishes a glass, same
slow swipe she’s seen before somewhere, staring over it. <em>Why’s he
watching?</em> She chugs the bottle, slams it down. No notebook, hands
slap her dress, empty. <em>Where this panic came from?</em>, she
screams: <code>BARTENDER—STARING—BAR—NO NOTES—</code> Ethan blinks,
<em>Lila, you good?</em>, voice steady, but his wrist flicks to a sleek
watch, too high-tech for a surfer. <code>TRAP—SET—WATCHING—</code> she
yells, bolting for the back, through the kitchen, past cooks flipping
sizzling patties. A knife glints on the counter, she grabs it, slips,
and it slices her palm. Pain stings, but no blood, wires spark, metal
gleams under torn skin, a faint blue glow pulsing. She freezes, screams:
<code>HAND—WIRES—ROBOT—WHAT—</code></p>
<p>Ethan’s voice fades, <em>Lila, wait!</em>, While she’s staring at her
palm for another second: gears whir, no blood, just a hum. <em>Android?
Cyborg?</em> Mind reels: <code>EXPERIMENT—ME—MACHINE—</code> She drops
the knife, staggers to the back room, screaming:
<code>MACHINE—TRAP—TEST—</code> A small window’s there; she shoves it
open, glass scraping her arms, and tumbles out onto fire escape ladder,
a dark alley, pavement wet, shadows thick. She scrambles up, dress
ripped, hand sparking faint, screams: <code>ALLEY—DARK—ESCAPE—</code>
Looks back, bar lights pulse, figures loom slow, too slow. Runs,
barefoot, into the night, machine or not, something’s hunting, no
notebook, no answers, just flight.</p>
<h1 id="the-echoes-to-reality">The Echoes to Reality</h1>
<h2 id="awakening-and-escape">Awakening and Escape</h2>
<p>I woke up to the smell of rotting takeout and something sticky in my
hair. <em>Gross.</em> My head pounded like I’d been hit by a truck, and
the sunlight stabbing through the dumpster lid wasn’t helping. <em>Wait,
dumpster?</em> Oh, right. Last night. The bar, the beer, the… hand
thing. I shuddered, pushing the memory down. <em>Not now.</em></p>
<p>I climbed out, wincing as my torn dress caught on the edge. My
sage-green sundress, once perfect for rooftop vibes, was now ripped at
the hem and stained with something I hoped was just ketchup. My feet
were bare, sandals long gone, lost in the chaos at Ethan’s. I glanced at
my reflection in a puddle, hair a tangled mess, mascara smudged, dress
ripped. Total disaster. But hey, still slay. I struck a pose, just to
remind myself who I was. Lila, golden girl of LA, not some paranoid
wreck.</p>
<p><em>Speaking of paranoid,</em> I checked my hand. Last night, I’d
sworn I saw wires, gears, and a faint blue glow under my skin. My heart
raced as I turned my palm over, but there was just a jagged, red cut, no
wires, no sparks, just my usual tan skin smudged with dirt. I let out a
shaky breath, relieved but still haunted by the memory. <em>Maybe it was
the alcohol, or that weird VR trial messing with my head.</em> I
couldn’t trust that white male persona, and asking someone else? No way.
<em>What if they saw something? Or worse, what if they didn’t?</em> I
wasn’t ready to find out.</p>
<p>I shook it off and started walking home. The alley opened to my
street, palm trees swaying like they were waving me back to reality.
Pastel cafes were opening, chalkboard signs advertising matcha lattes
and avocado toast. The smell of fresh coffee wafted by, and for a
second, I felt like myself again. Then I noticed the barista. He was
wiping down tables, but his eyes locked on me, lingering too long.
<em>Was it my messy hair, or did he know something?</em> I quickened my
pace, heart thudding. <em>Maybe I was just paranoid. Maybe not.</em></p>
<p>At my building, my stomach dropped. The door was ajar, the lock
hanging loose like a broken promise. I pushed it open, and chaos greeted
me. Furniture flipped, drawers yanked out, papers scattered like
confetti. My neon <strong>Good Vibes</strong> sign flickered, half-dark,
like it was mocking me. Succulents lay toppled, dirt spilled across the
floor. Even my vanity mirror was cracked, a jagged line splitting my
reflection.</p>
<p>I snapped a quick selfie, me pouting, chaos in the background.
<em>"Vibes even in chaos" - I’d caption it later.</em> It was silly, but
it grounded me. I grabbed my phone, charger, my favorite cream sundress
with the tiny daisies, and my charm bracelet from Mia. The little golden
sun pendant glinted, a reminder of better days. I clutched it tight,
needing that connection.</p>
<p>I texted Mia: <em>SOS. Place wrecked. Can I crash?</em> Her reply
came fast: <em>Can’t talk, parents’ mess.</em>. What? Mia was always
there for me. Something was wrong, but I couldn’t deal with it now. So,
Ethan. <em>Hey, can I crash at your place? Emergency</em>. His reply was
almost instant: <em>Come over, babe</em>. Too fast, maybe, but I was
desperate. I stuffed my tote, spritzed vanilla perfume, <em>confidence
in a bottle</em>, and headed out.</p>
<p>I ran through LA, bare feet slapping the pavement, sandals still
missing. The sunset painted everything gold, glass buildings glowing
like they were on fire. A street performer strummed a guitar, singing
about love and loss. People stared at my messy hair and torn dress. A
skateboarder slowed down, eyeing me. A woman with a stroller gave me a
disapproving look. <em>Let them stare.</em> I flipped my hair, chin up.
Still gorgeous.</p>
<p>But then I saw him, a bartender across the street, leaning against a
doorframe, polishing a glass. His narrow eyes watched me, just like the
guy from last night. <em>Creepy.</em> I made a mental note:
<code>possible stalker</code>.</p>
<p>I reached Ethan’s bungalow, out of breath. He opened the door before
I knocked, smiling wide. <em>Too wide, maybe.</em> His watch caught the
light, glinting oddly, too fancy for a surfer. <em>Thanks for letting me
crash</em>, I said, forcing a smile. <em>Anytime, babe</em>, he replied,
leading me to the basement. <em>You’ll be safe here</em>. Safe? I hoped
so, but something felt off. I brushed it aside, too exhausted to care. I
needed sleep, a shower, and answers. <em>Tomorrow.</em></p>
<h2 id="vacay-vibes">Vacay Vibes</h2>
<p>I settled into Ethan’s basement, and okay, it was kind of adorable.
Fairy lights crisscrossed the ceiling, casting a soft, golden glow over
the futon where I’d be crashing. There was a mini-fridge humming in the
corner, a stack of old magazines, and a fluffy blanket that screamed
cozy vibes. But then I clocked the weird stuff: cameras mounted high in
the corners, a server rack blinking with tiny green lights, and a router
that looked way too fancy for a surfer’s basement. <em>Like, what
even?</em> It felt more like a tech nerd’s lair than Ethan’s chill
hangout spot. I snapped a quick pic for Insta, futon, fairy lights, the
works, and captioned it <em>"hideout goals"</em>, but the tech gear? It
made my stomach twist. <em>What was Ethan hiding?</em></p>
<p><em>Speaking of Ethan,</em> he popped in to check on me, flashing
that dimpled smile that usually made me melt. But his watch caught my
eye again, sleek, silver, definitely not a surfer’s vibe. And then he
did this weird thing where he adjusted his ear, like he was listening to
something. <em>Super odd.</em> I made a mental note but didn’t say
anything. <em>Maybe he was just quirky, right?</em></p>
<p>I needed answers after last night, so I grabbed my phone and started
scrolling news apps. <em>Something was up, I could feel it,</em> and I
wasn’t about to sit here clueless. First hit: a vague blurb about a
<em>"disturbance at a downtown bar"</em>. No names, no details, just
noise. Typical. Then a sharper headline: <em>"Cargo Ship Sinks Off
Coast, Suspected Trafficking Bust"</em>. The article was thin, something
about dozens of Asian illegals feared dead, Coast Guard scrambling, no
clear culprit. My chest tightened. <em>Trafficking?</em> Next up:
<em>"Gang Clash Leaves Five Dead in Chinatown"</em>. Chinese and Haitian
crews tearing into each other, knives and guns, a bloody mess over
territory. Cops were baffled, locals spooked. Then, buried in a sidebar:
<em>"Hospital Overrun After Terror Attack Rumors"</em>. No specifics,
just chaos at some ER, patients flooding in, whispers of <em>"VR trial
subjects"</em> tied to it, whatever that meant. <em>Wait, VR trial? Like
mine?</em></p>
<p>My palms got sweaty as I swiped between articles, headlines piling up
like puzzle pieces I couldn’t fit. The ship, trafficking, Asian ties.
The gang fight, Chinese vs. Haitian, raw and violent. The hospital,
vague, unconnected, but that <em>"VR trial"</em> bit gnawed at me.
<em>Was this tied to last night? To Mia’s "parents’ mess"?</em> I
flipped to Insta for a breather, but Mia’s story was just a black screen
captioned <em>"chaos"</em> No help there. I tossed my phone onto the
futon, head spinning. <em>Too many dots, no lines.</em></p>
<p>I raided the mini-fridge, snagging a frozen pizza. Popped it in the
microwave, the gooey cheese melting into something comforting. Then I
spotted a margarita machine in the closet, dusty but begging for action.
<em>Vacay vibes</em>, I thought, giggling as I mixed a pink, frothy
drink. I sipped it, the sweetness masking the tequila’s bite. But then
the room tilted, and my vision blurred. <em>Oh no. The alcohol.</em> It
was happening again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, everything snapped into focus, but not in a good way. My
mind raced, stitching those headlines into a jagged web. The cameras in
here, the server blinking, Ethan’s fancy watch, the ship sinking, the
gangs fighting, Mia’s cryptic post, it all felt linked. I grabbed a
napkin and scribbled:
<code>Ship + gangs = Mia’s parents? VR hospital clue?</code> My hand
shook as I wrote, the memory of wires in my palm flashing back, sharp,
blue, unreal. I couldn’t shake it. I had to tell Ethan. <em>Maybe he
knew something.</em> Napkin’s a mess, ink smeared, clutched tight.
Scribbles screaming:
<code>Ethan’s a rat? Phone call, trap? Mia’s next?</code> Head spins,
margarita sloshes in gut, sour and sticky. Legs feel like rubber, but
brain’s buzzing, cameras wink red, fairy lights pulse. Overheard him
upstairs, voice low, calm. <em>Trap. All of it. VR. Hospital. Mia.</em>
Gotta tell him I know.</p>
<p>Stumble up basement stairs, walls tilt, grip railing, slips, wet
palms. Napkin flaps, <em>proof in my face.</em> Living room’s bright,
Ethan’s there, phone down, eyes narrow. Too cool, too slick. My mouth
opens, words sludge out, thick, useless. <em>You... set... up...</em>
Tongue’s fat, drunk, failing. Screw it, scream it, like always. Lungs
rip open: <em>TRAP—ETHAN—RAT—</em> Voice booms, sloppy, raw.
<em>PHONE—LIAR—WATCHING—</em> Napkin shakes, fist slams air, words hit
hard, good enough.</p>
<p>Ethan blinks, slow, hands up. <em>Lila, relax, you’re drunk.</em>
Calm, too damn calm. <em>He’s fake</em>. Smirk hiding, I see it.
Conspiracy. Step back, legs wobble, heart’s a hammer.
<em>SHUT—UP—TRAP—</em> Scream’s louder, throat’s fire, alcohol fuels it.
He moves, slow, toward me, control move, obvious. Panic hits, sharp,
electric. <em>Run. Now.</em></p>
<p>Twist, crash down stairs, basement smells, damp, wires, pizza crust.
Door bangs shut, lock’s loud, too loud. Cameras stare, lights flicker,
watching me. Napkin drops, ink bleeds on floor, no time. Second exit,
back wall, small door to kitchen. <em>Spotted it before</em>,
half-blocked, cluttered. Shove through, hands scrape wood, knees bang,
pain’s dull, drunk-dumb.</p>
<p>Kitchen’s a blur, pizza grease, spilled lime, sink’s wet. Counter’s
slick, climb it, slip, crash into cups, they shatter, loud. Window’s
open, tight fit. Squeeze out, shirt rips, hit grass, cold, rough. City’s
alive, lights smear, horns blare far off. Feet slap ground, running,
breath’s short, lungs sting. Ethan yells, faint, <em>Lila, stop!</em>,
cool, too cool, trap voice. Screw him. Sprint harder, city swallows me,
shadows twist, lights blind. Gone. For now.</p>
<h2 id="her-eyes-shift">Her Eyes Shift</h2>
<p>City’s a kaleidoscope, lights smear into wet pavement, reds, blues,
yellows pooling like blood. Bare feet slap concrete, sandals ditched at
Ethan’s, lost in the scramble. Alcohol’s heavy, sloshing in my brain,
blurring edges. Legs shake, but thoughts race, cameras in the hospital,
Ethan’s watch glinting, Mia’s texts buzzing cryptic. <em>It’s a
web.</em> VR trial, attack, Mia’s place, gotta get there. But my head’s
a sieve, leaking details. <em>Need a notebook. Need to write it
down.</em> Can’t trust my mind, not now.</p>
<p>Street bends, neon buzzes. Vendor cart ahead, stacked with junk,
pens, cheap spiral notebooks, crumpled gum wrappers. Guy’s got a beard,
squinting at me. Face flickers, Ethan’s smirk slides over his jaw, then
back. Blink hard. <em>Not real?</em> Alcohol’s screwing me up. Grab a
notebook, black, flimsy, five bucks. Fumble Ethan’s cash from my pocket,
crumpled bills. <em>This enough?</em> Voice slurs, thick, sloppy. He
nods, slow, eyes linger. <em>Too long. Too damn long.</em> Is he Ethan?
<span class="nodecor">Eli</span> from the store? The Jew’s sharp nose
cuts across his face, then gone. Paranoia’s a torch, burning white-hot.
Scream rips out: <code>WHO—YOU—SPY?—</code> Voice cracks, raw, echoes
off brick. He flinches, steps back, <em>guilty move, obvious.</em> Stuff
the notebook in my tote, bolt.</p>
<p><em>Pen, need a pen.</em> Dig through the bag, past a tampon, a
lighter, there, blue ballpoint. Scribble fast:
<code>Vendor = Ethan? Eli? Watching me.</code> Heart’s hammering,
breath’s shallow. Alcohol’s fading, but this, this shift in me, it’s
sharper now. <em>Like a switch flipped when I drank.</em> Not used to
it, not yet, but it’s keeping me moving.</p>
<p>Alley looms, dark, wet. Shadows twist, someone’s there. Ethan? No,
just a kid, kicking a can. But his jaw shifts, Ethan’s dimples, then
back. <em>Hallucination.</em> Note it:
<code>Kid = Ethan? Following?</code> Like agents swapping faces,
tracking me. Can’t trust my eyes. Keep running, notebook clutched tight.
Streetlights blink: one, two, three. Stop. <em>Four’s a signal, means
they’re close.</em> Note it:
<code>Lights, three blinks, possible code.</code></p>
<p>Crowd ahead, faces swivel. Torn dress, wild hair, I’m a mess,
sticking out. A guy steps up, <em>Hey, you lost?</em> His voice dips,
Ethan’s drawl, then normal. Back off, fast.
<code>STAY—BACK—SETUP—</code> He flinches, hands up. Push through,
elbows sharp. Woman next, holding a phone, filming? Her eyes shift,
<span class="nodecor">Eli</span>’s glint, then gone. Note it:
<code>Woman = Eli? Spying.</code> Everyone’s a threat, every face a
mask.</p>
<p>Taxi rolls up, headlights stab the dark. Driver leans out - <em>Need
a lift?</em>. Too easy. Trap. Scream it: <code>NO—TAXI—NO—</code> He
peels away, tires squeal. No taxis, no buses, public stuff’s a cage.
They’d pin me down, track me. Feet keep pounding, raw now, stinging. Bar
ahead, "Cold Beer" sign flickering. Bartender outside, wiping a glass,
same squint as the vendor, as <span class="nodecor">Eli</span>. Face
morphs, Ethan’s stubble, then back. Note it:
<code>Bartender = Ethan? Eli? Tailing me.</code> Duck right, past a
dumpster, reek of garbage, sour booze. Stomach lurches, hold it
down.</p>
<p>Car horn blares, three short bursts. <em>Code?</em> Note it:
<code>Horns, three, signal.</code> Head’s spinning, pavement dips. Grab
a wall, bricks scrape my palm. Flashback hits, hospital, shovel
swinging, blood splattering tiles. <em>Real?</em> News said attack, but
holes in the story. Alcohol’s messing with me, or this persona is. It’s
like I’m him, the white male from before, paranoid, scribbling, running.
But I’m not him. Not yet.</p>
<p>Mia’s building rises, glass, gleaming, fifth floor. Almost there.
Alley shortcut, trash bags glisten, a rat skitters. Figure ahead, Ethan?
Tall, broad shoulders, moving fast. Or not, streetlight hits, it’s just
a jogger. Face shifts, Ethan’s grin, <span class="nodecor">Eli</span>’s
stare, then normal. Note it:
<code>Jogger = Ethan? Eli? Can’t tell.</code> Notebook’s pages are full,
ink smudged, paranoia in blue scrawl. Legs burn, lungs ache. Alcohol’s
draining, slow, like mud settling. This shift, I get it now. <em>Booze
triggers it,</em> turns me jagged, watchful. <em>Useful, maybe,</em> but
I’m not ready for it.</p>
<p>Steps to Mia’s door, concrete bites my soles. Rail’s icy, pull myself
up. Breath’s a wheeze, head’s a drumbeat. Knock, sharp, three times.
Silence. Mia’s here. <em>Maybe answers. Maybe not.</em> Notebook’s heavy
in my hand, <em>proof I’m not losing it. Yet.</em></p>
<h2 id="tangled-in-this">Tangled in This</h2>
<p>I stumbled into Mia’s loft, my chest heaving from the sprint across
the city, bare feet stinging against the hardwood. The buzz from Ethan’s
margarita was gone, leaving me sober but jittery, my tote banging
against my hip. Mia’s place was my haven, exposed brick, fairy lights,
that vintage vibe she loved, but now it felt wrong, like the air itself
was holding its breath.</p>
<p>I froze. The room was trashed. Couch cushions were slashed open,
stuffing spilling out like snow. A lamp lay shattered by the wall, and
papers, receipts, sketches, random notes, littered the floor. My eyes
caught on a torn qipao near the coffee table, its red silk shredded into
jagged strips. Mia had worn that dress last Lunar New Year, laughing as
she spun under the lanterns. Seeing it wrecked hit me like a punch.</p>
<p>Then I saw them, my old sneakers, shoved under the couch, scuffed
gray with frayed laces. A memory flickered: that rare LA rain last
spring, Mia giggling as we splashed through streets turned to rivers.
<em>"We’ve got umbrellas, babe, we’re prepared!"</em> she’d said, but
the downpour soaked us anyway. I’d kicked off my drenched shoes here to
dry, forgotten them after a night of takeout and tarot cards. I slipped
them on now, the familiar fit grounding me, a piece of us before
everything went south.</p>
<p>I stepped closer, heart thudding. On the counter, Mia’s phone glowed,
unlocked. I snatched it up. Three missed calls from Ethan glared back at
me, and my stomach flipped. Texts from an unknown number followed:
<em>"Family debts can’t wait"</em> and <em>"Keep quiet, or it gets
worse"</em>. Then I saw it, a sticky note on the fridge, half-ripped,
with an address scrawled in Mia’s handwriting: <em>"Red Lantern Lounge,
Chinatown"</em>.</p>
<p>My mind raced. Mia’s parents had always dodged questions about their
<em>"business"</em>, but this, debts, threats, a struggle, screamed
something darker. <em>Drugs? Trafficking? Money laundering tied to the
Chinese mafia?</em> And Ethan’s name on her phone? He wasn’t just some
creep from the basement; he was tangled in this. I couldn’t call the
cops, his betrayal made me paranoid about who he knew, how far his reach
went.</p>
<p>I needed to think sharper, faster. That’s when it clicked: the
alcohol. It flipped a switch in me, turning me into this
hyper-analytical, paranoid version of myself I’d started calling
<em>"WMD" - White Male Drunk</em>, a twisted side effect from that VR
trial. It scared me, especially after what I’d seen, or thought I’d
seen, in my hand at the bar. <em>Wires, maybe,</em> glowing faintly
blue. I hadn’t looked since, too afraid to confirm it, but Mia was in
danger. I’d risk it for her.</p>
<p>I spotted a sleek tequila bottle on Mia’s bar cart, the glass cool
against my fingers as I poured a shot. My hand hovered, trembling.
<em>You don’t have to do this.</em> But I did. For Mia. I tipped it
back, the burn searing my throat, and waited. The shift hit fast, my
thoughts splintered, then locked into place, razor-sharp. The room
snapped into focus: the slashed cushions, the torn qipao, the sticky
note. I grabbed a notepad from Mia’s desk and scribbled:
<code>Red Lantern Lounge, Mia taken? Ethan’s calls, tracking her? Family debts, money laundering?</code></p>
<p>My hand shook as I wrote, and in the dim light, I caught a flicker,
something blue under my skin. I yanked my gaze away. <em>Not now. Mia
first.</em> The white male mode churned: the address was a lead, the
lounge a front, Ethan a threat. I had to move.</p>
<p>I bolted out of the loft, sneakers pounding the pavement, the LA
night swallowing me whole. Neon signs buzzed overhead, casting jagged
shadows on graffiti-tagged walls. My tote bounced against my side, the
air thick with salt and exhaust. I was tense, every corner hiding Ethan
or some goon he’d sent. First stop: the Red Lantern Lounge in Chinatown.
Mia was counting on me, and I wasn’t stopping now.</p>
<p>First stop: the Chinatown bar from the note. It crouched behind red
lanterns, their glow painting the street crimson. A bouncer loomed out
front, arms crossed, a dragon tattoo curling up his neck, <em>mafia
vibes screaming loud.</em> I scribbled in my notepad:
<code>Bar, front for something? Basement door, voices. Mia here?</code>
The WMD mode scanned everything: his rigid stance, the way people
slipped inside, heads low, the faint hum from below. My paranoia spiked,
<em>every shadow could be a trap</em>, but I clenched my jaw. Mia was
counting on me, and I wasn’t stopping now.</p>
<h2 id="hot-across-my-face">Hot Across My Face</h2>
<p>Red Lantern Lounge squats in Chinatown, neon pulsing, red glow
slashing shadows across wet pavement. Sneakers pound concrete, tequila
cuts every edge sharp. Bouncer hulks at the door, dragon tattoo coils up
his neck, scales flash like a blade. <em>Mafia mark.</em> I shove in,
eyes sweep fast: smoke hangs thick, glasses clink low, voices mutter
tight.</p>
<p>I snag a booth, notepad gripped hard, I scan: silk jacket guy growls
at the bartender. <em>Traffickers botched it. Took the girl. We need to
push back or we’re bled dry</em>, he spits, voice low, venom dripping.
<em>Mia’s family? Money crew?</em> Pen digs in:
<code>Lounge, front for cash game, Mia snagged by traffickers, trade talk.</code></p>
<p>Place reeks of gang. Dealers slump at the bar, girls in tight skirts
glide, eyes cold, working the room. <em>Controlled, no chaos.</em>
Silk-suit guy keeps going: <em>Boss says trade the cash, get her free.
Traitors want her for leverage</em>. My pen races:
<code>Zhangs bargaining, Mia hostage, trafficking crew’s play.</code>
Family’s desperate, not running this show. Tequila burns, paranoia
spikes. <em>Every face hides a knife.</em></p>
<p>Harbor Street sprawls dark, warehouses loom like graves. Number 47
gapes, windows black, padlock swings loose. I circle, pry a board, slip
in. Oil and dust choke me, crates stack high, Chinese script stamped
deep. First one’s junk: clothes, bottles, nothing. Second’s the same:
papers, trash. Third’s heavy, I crack it, dig past crates of rice, hit a
false bottom: cash stacks, ledgers, fake passports. Names, dates, sums
glare up, Zhangs scrawled bold. <em>Family’s dirty, laundering cash, not
moving bodies.</em> Pen flies:
<code>Warehouse, Zhangs run money, not trafficking.</code></p>
<p>Footsteps thud, I duck behind a crate, pulse slams. Two suits shuffle
in, grumble low. <em>Traffickers want payment, holding her till we cough
it up</em>, one says. Mia. One’s face warps, <span
class="nodecor">Eli</span>’s eyes glint, then blink out. Tequila’s claws
dig, I jot:
<code>Mia hostage, traffickers’ leverage, family’s cornered.</code> I
slide out, heart pounding, trail their voices two blocks.</p>
<p>Golden Dragon Enterprises looms, door ajar, light leaking. I creep
in, hallway stretches into dark. Fluorescents buzz, drilling my skull.
Doors line up, locked, cold. One’s open, voices slip out, Mandarin,
clipped. <em>...if they did not pay can we use her?</em>. Mia. I flatten
against the wall, notepad ready, peek through. Two inside: suit pacing,
desk guy buried in papers. Third mutters into a phone.</p>
<p><em>Need in.</em> Shadow shifts, I duck into a broom closet, shelves
jab my ribs. Phone guy stalks past, voice cuts: <em>Bullshit. They was
under our boss, till higher up split us, to demonopolize they said, now
we have internal war on our hands</em>. Mia’s their chokehold, family’s
desperate. He locks the office, splits. I’m pinned, rifle the closet,
find a vent, knee-high, grate loose. <em>Old trick,</em> I yank it,
metal squeals, crawl through, dust gags me, elbows bang steel. Duct
spits me into an empty office, door ajar.</p>
<p>Inside’s a mess: files spill, mug’s tipped, photos pinned up. I dig,
adrenaline spiking. Manifest lists cash drops, ports, codes. Photo:
silk-suit guy from the lounge, shaking hands with some stiff in a suit.
<em>Family ally?</em> Paper scraps in English: <em>"Secure the Triad
split"</em>. Pen scratches: <code>Zhangs’ faction link?</code> Computer
glows, login taunts. Type "password", dead. "Zhang", nothing. "Mia2008",
screen flares. <em>Idiots.</em> Files flood: emails, blurry stills, map
with pins, ports, warehouses, hotel off the 405. Email bites: <em>"Pay
the traffickers or she’s done"</em>. Mia’s their pawn. I hit print,
machine hums, map spits out. Stuff it in my tote, ears strain. Keys
jingle. Kill the screen, dive behind a filing cabinet. Suit guy storms
back, nose twitching. <em>Smells me?</em> I freeze, tequila sweat
stinks. He curses in Mandarin, locks up, splits.</p>
<p>Breath shakes out. Map crinkles in my tote, pins glare. Hotel pin,
circled twice, red ink, room 12. Mia’s there. Has to be. Photo’s noise,
<em>"Triad split"</em> is family bullshit. Mia’s no spy, just leverage.
Trafficking crew’s got her, not Zhangs. I rip the notepad out, scribble
hard:
<code>Hotel, 405, Room 12, Mia hostage, trafficking split, not family.</code>
Pen trembles, ink smears. Focus. Hotel. Now.</p>
<p>Step out, alley stink fades. Hotel’s a mile, past docks. Walkable. No
cabs, <em>tracked too easy.</em> Legs shake, tequila thins. Head clears,
paranoia hums. <em>Good.</em> Need it sharp.</p>
<p>Docks reek of salt and rot, ships groan in the black. I hug shadows,
eyes dart. Dockworker glances, face flickers, <span
class="nodecor">Eli</span>’s nose, then gone.
<em>ELI—HERE—WATCHING—</em> I scream in my head, hands twitch for the
notepad, too fast to stop. Keep moving.</p>
<p>Red Lotus Hotel sign buzzes, "Vacancy" flickers. Room 12’s light
glows, curtains twitch. Someone’s in. Mia? <em>Trap?</em> I creep close,
heart slams. Figure paces inside, sharp shadow. Not Mia. Too tall. Gang
thug. <em>Guarding? Waiting?</em> Scribble quick:
<code>Room 12, guard, not Mia, trap?</code></p>
<p><em>Need closer.</em> Alley behind the hotel’s dark, quiet. Sneak
spot. I slip around, sneakers hushed on gravel. Back door’s ajar, light
bleeds. Voices growl, low: <em>Keep her quiet. Boss wants her breathing
for the trade</em>. Mia. Alive. Relief stabs, then rage. They’ve got
her. Here.</p>
<p><em>Need to see.</em> Window’s grimy, half-open. Peer in, Mia’s tied
to a chair, gag biting her mouth, eyes wide. Two guys inside: one paces,
one cleans a gun. Blood boils. WMD rage claws up. <em>End them.
Now.</em> Flip the notepad, pen gouges:
<code>Mia, tied, two men, gun, kill them.</code> Rage shakes my hand,
blue glow pulses under skin, <em>real or not.</em></p>
<p>First, the guard outside. He steps out, cigarette flares. Same
bastard from before. My prey. I stalk, silent, into the alley. Dead-end
ahead. <em>Perfect.</em></p>
<p>He stops, lights another. I lunge, hands lock his neck. <em>Where’s
Mia?</em> I snarl. He thrashes, elbow slams my ribs. Pain bursts,
breath’s gone. <em>Crazy bitch!</em> he spits, fist flies. I duck,
knuckles graze my temple, skin splits, blood trickles warm.</p>
<p>Reel back, vision swims, fire roars louder.
<code>KEY—WHERE—GIVE—</code> I scream, voice rips raw. He laughs, wet,
mocking, swings again. Dodge tight, slam my elbow into his kidney. He
grunts, lurches. Grab his collar, yank, smash his face into the wall.
Bone cracks, blood sprays, tooth skitters across pavement. He roars,
flails, nose gushes. Hook my arm around his throat, squeeze hard. Nails
claw my skin, blood wells, arms burn. <code>TELL—ME—MIA—</code> I
bellow, scream splits my skull, need answers, need keys. Kicks fade, he
slumps, fakes it. Let go, step back. He whirls, fist crashes my jaw.
Blood floods my mouth, copper sharp, stars explode.</p>
<p>Spit red, charge. Knee rams his gut, he doubles, gags. Snatch a brick
off the ground, swing. Skull cracks, wet, sick thud, blood splatters hot
across my face. He screams, gurgling, I swing again. Cheekbone caves,
teeth fly, one sticks in the wall, blood streaks. Again, eye socket
crushes, orb pops, jelly mixes crimson. Again, jaw shatters, bone shards
pierce flesh, teeth scatter like gravel. Last swing, skull caves, brain
splashes the alley floor. He twitches, stills, a wrecked heap.</p>
<p>Panting, drop to my knees beside him, hands slick with gore. Stench
hits, blood, piss, sweat. <em>Need keys, keycard, anything.</em> Dig his
jacket, left pocket: receipts, lighter, trash. Right: cash roll,
twenties, tens. Stuff it in my tote, hands shake. Pants: gum, condom,
nothing. Wallet’s cheap, peeling, fake ID, <span class="nodecor">John
Lon</span>, 23, dead cards, dog pic. Useless. Toss it, check socks,
shoes, rip his shirt. Nothing. No key. No card. Just a dead nobody.
Paranoia claws my chest, <em>has to be something.</em> Nothing.
<code>NO—KEY—WASTED—ALL—</code> I scream, throat raw, sound splits the
night.</p>
<p>Stand, trembling, brick clunks down. Gore coats me, blood, brain,
bits of him. Head throbs, tequila fades, clarity cuts cold. <em>Useless
kill. No lead. Just meat.</em> He earned it, gang trash, took her, paid
up. Thought slices sharp. Then: <em>His blood’s on me. Face gone. What’d
I do?</em> Snap back: <em>Justice.</em> Scum gets no mercy. Means to an
end. Softer: <em>A guy, maybe. Not in it. Dead for nothing.</em> Cold:
<em>Collateral.</em> She’s worth it. Focus. Guilt creeps: <em>Worth
this? I’m not this.</em> Or am I? Truth hits: <em>You are now. Live it.
Find her or lose her.</em></p>
<p>Map in my tote shifts, crinkles. Hotel pin. Next move. Head clears.
Step on. Thoughts lock there. Nod, steady, limp out, ruin stays
behind.</p>
<h2 id="cry-from-my-throat">Cry From My Throat</h2>
<p>The alley’s blood-stink clung to me, the thug’s smashed skull a ghost
in my head. I slumped against a dumpster a block from the hotel, my tote
heavy with the map and his cash. Tequila buzzed, fading slow, making my
hands twitch, my thoughts jagged. I’d waited it out, <em>as long as it
takes</em>, until the edge dulled, the world around stopped being so
suspicious, the blue glow under my skin dimming to nothing. My breath
steadied, the pounding in my skull eased. No more screams, no more brick
swings. I was me again, Lila, the LA girl with the golden curls and
killer smile. The hotel pin, Room 12 off the 405, burned in my mind. Mia
was there, tied up, scared. I’d seen her. Killing that thug got me
nothing but gore. Time to be smart.</p>
<p>I smoothed my sage-green dress, ripped at the hem but still clinging
to my curves. My tank top was fresh from the tote, white, tight, a
little faded, replacing the blood-soaked shirt I’d ditched. Hair wild, I
flipped it back, letting it catch the streetlight. <em>"Still
gorgeous"</em> That was my ticket now. The gang wouldn’t clock a flirty
party girl as the one who’d bashed their buddy’s brains out. I headed
in, sandals crunching gravel, the neon "Vacancy" sign flickering
ahead.</p>
<p>The hotel parking lot thrummed with bass, cars scattered across the
cracked asphalt under dim streetlights. Neon pulsed from the lounge
inside, laughter and bottles clinking over the noise. A guy leaned
against a sedan, joint glowing, dragon tattoo curling up his arm,
<em>gang muscle.</em> I sauntered over, hips swaying, grin bright.
<em>Hey, this the party? Heard it’s wild</em>. My voice dripped charm,
light and teasing.</p>
<p>He smirked, eyes raking me up and down. <em>You got something for us,
princess?</em> I giggled, pulling a crumpled twenty from the thug’s
stash, twirling it. <em>Cash for drinks. I’m fun, promise.</em> He
nodded, stepping aside. <em>Get in</em>.</p>
<p>Inside, the air was thick, a heady mix of sweat, weed, and spilled
beer. No feverish crowd here, just gang blood and their girls lounging
lazy, coiled tight. Neon lights bathed the room in a pulsing glow, pink
and blue streaks sliding over tattooed skin and leather cuts. A table
groaned under the weight of empty bottles, and pills as confetti across
the wood. I needed to go deeper, past the guards, closer to Mia. My
target, my mission.</p>
<p>A group of guys, tattooed, drunk, and loud, lounged near the bar,
passing a joint between them. Their laughter was sharp, their eyes
predatory. <em>Perfect</em>. I zeroed in, flashing a smile that promised
trouble, tossing my hair like a weapon. <em>Hey, boys</em>, I called, my
voice dripping with honeyed mischief. <em>Room for one more?</em> They
erupted into cheers, pulling me into their circle. Hands found my waist,
my hips, fingers brushing against my skin with a boldness that made my
pulse quicken. I laughed, low and throaty, leaning into their touch,
letting them think I was theirs for the taking. <em>Got anything
fun?</em> I purred, my gaze flicking to the pills scattered like
Halloween candies.</p>
<p>One of them, bald with a jagged scar across his cheek, grinned and
shoved a shot glass into my hand. <em>Drink up, sweetheart</em>, he
slurred, his eyes dark with intent. I laughed, twirling away from him,
holding the glass up like a prop. <em>Come on, guys, I’m too young for
alcohol, you know? Give a girl something to start the night</em>. I
winked, popping a bright blue pill from the table into my mouth before
he could argue, letting it sit on my tongue for a beat, sharp, chemical,
erratic, then swallowing with a dramatic shiver. Another guy slid his
arm around me, his breath hot and damp against my neck. <em>Stick with
us, baby,</em> he murmured, his hand slipping lower, testing my
boundaries. I giggled, twisting out of his grip, spinning into the lap
of the next guy, a wiry man with a gold chain and hungry eyes.
<em>Strategy, not surrender.</em></p>
<p>The vibe shifted fast. The bald guy grabbed my wrist, pulling me back
to him, his hand sliding up my thigh with a possessiveness that made my
skin prickle. I played along, heart racing, straddling him for a moment,
my lips brushing his ear. <em>You’re trouble</em>, I whispered, my voice
a sultry tease, before slipping away, laughing as I moved to the next.
The wiry guy grabbed my ass, his grip firm, and I swayed against him,
letting him think he had me. The group closed in around me, hands
roaming my chest, my hips, my thighs, each touch a calculated risk. I
danced between them, a whirlwind of heat and temptation, their laughter
turning guttural, their hunger palpable. But I needed one, not all.</p>
<p>Then I saw him. Across the room, he stood like a storm waiting to
break, tall, lean, radiating a chaotic energy that made the air hum with
electricity. His black tank clung to his torso, a second skin stretched
taut over every chiseled ridge of muscle, the fabric damp with sweat
that glistened under the dim lights. His ripped jeans slung low, teasing
the sharp V of his hips, a dangerous promise of what lay beneath. A
jagged scar sliced down his forearm, raw and brutal, a testament to
battles carved into his flesh. No polished charm, no sleek watch. Just
pure, unfiltered danger, a man who wore his wildness like a crown.</p>
<p>He cut through the room like a beast on the hunt, broad shoulders
shoving bodies aside with a guttural growl that vibrated in my bones.
<em>She’s mine tonight</em>, he snarled, his voice a rough, possessive
rasp that coiled around my spine and squeezed. Before I could blink, his
hand clamped around my wrist, yanking me into him with a strength that
stole my breath. The others scattered, their muttered curses fading into
the haze as I collided with his chest, my palms flattening against the
searing heat of him. His scent, leather, smoke, and something darker,
flooded my senses, intoxicating and primal. I tilted my head, lips
grazing the shell of his ear, my voice a sultry purr dripping with sin.
<em>Hey, big guy</em>. The words hung between us, thick with invitation,
and his grin flashed, feral, untamed, a predator savoring its prey. In
one swift move, he dragged me through a side door into a dim room, bare
except for a stained mattress and a flickering bulb.</p>
<p>The door slammed shut, and he had me, back against the wall, rough
hands shoving my dress up, hem bunching high. Cool air kissed my exposed
flesh, but his heat consumed me, his hard body pressed flush against
mine, cock thick and grinding through denim, shameless intent clear. His
fingers sank into my curves, bruising and claiming, pinning me as his
breath rasped hot on my throat. I arched into him, helpless against his
tidal wave, pulse hammering. His teeth grazed my neck, a sharp,
deliberate bite drawing a gasp from my lips, the sting igniting a molten
rush pooling low in my belly. My nails clawed his back, shredding his
tank, raking skin, leaving angry red streaks. He groaned, a deep, animal
sound shuddering through me, setting every nerve alight.</p>
<p>The air crackled between us, a live wire of dominance and surrender.
His hands ripped under my tank, calluses scraping ribs, thumbs teasing
my breasts, cruel and slow till I whimpered. A moan tore out, raw, wild,
unstoppable. His mouth crashed into mine, a bruising collision of lips
and tongues, all heat and hunger. I bit back, tasting sweat, violence,
melting under his grip. Fingers twisted my hair, yanked my head back,
throat bare, and he devoured it, sucking, biting, marking me his,
stubble burning sweet against my skin.</p>
<p>He was everywhere, scent choking me, hands claiming every inch, hips
slamming a rhythm screaming ruin. Thighs shook as he kicked my legs
apart, denim grinding my soaked panties, dragging a cry from my throat.
He growled, dark eyes blazing triumph, then shoved me onto the mattress.
Pants hit the floor, his cock sprung free, thick, hard, veins pulsing.
No words, just a snarl as he tore my panties aside and drove in. Hot,
stretching me tight, warmth flooding down my legs, slick and messy. I
clawed the sheets, gasping, his thrusts deep, relentless, pounding me
into the filthy bed. Sweat dripped, his growl mixed with my moans, room
spinning as he fucked me raw, wild, brutal, no mercy. Teetering on the
edge, body screaming, mind blank but for him, he pushed harder, claiming
every shudder till I broke, a ragged cry ripping free.</p>
<p>Panting, he pulled out, smirking feral, cum dripping down my thighs.
My mind flickered, Ethan’s voice cutting through the haze, steady and
smooth, too damn perfect. <em>You’re okay, Lila</em>. A rehearsed lie,
cool, distant, a handler’s tone. My head spun, Ethan wasn’t just shady,
he was pulling strings, maybe this whole mess. This guy was the
opposite, chaos incarnate, his touch a wildfire scorching doubt clean. I
shoved up, breathless, giggling to mask it. <em>Need a sec, stud</em>.
He swaggered out, back to the lounge. I stumbled to the hall, heart
slamming, bass fading. A "Storage" door gaped, a closet with boxes
stacked, a mop leaning crooked. I slipped in, quiet, safe. Waited hours
till the place went dead. That pill’d keep me wired till dawn. Dug
through a box, found a half-empty bottle of whiskey and a red pill,
jagged edge. Slammed both down, the burn snapping the white male
awake.</p>
<p><em>MIA—NEAR—FIND—NOW—</em> roared in my skull, pen scratching the
notepad: <code>Rooms check Mia close.</code> Blue glow flickered under
my skin. <em>Not real.</em> Time to hunt.</p>
<h2 id="tracing-lazy-circles">Tracing Lazy Circles</h2>
<p>The whiskey stink hit my throat, a hot burn waking the beast inside.
The closet door banged open behind me, party noise fading to a dull hum.
I stumbled into the hallway, boots scuffing the carpet, eyes darting.
Room 12 loomed ahead, door cracked, light bleeding out. I shoved in.
Empty. Mia’s chair tipped over, ropes limp like dead snakes. A girl
cowered in the corner, all shaky limbs and big eyes. <em>Where’s
Mia?</em> I barked, voice rough, too loud.</p>
<p><em>Basement</em>, she mumbled, pointing down the hall. <em>They took
her</em>. Her words twisted in my skull. <em>Liar? Trap?</em> I
scratched fast in my notepad: <code>Girl basement Mia check</code> and
bolted down the hall. The stairwell door creaked open, concrete steps
dropping into shadow. Each echo bounced like the VR trial prison, rusted
bars and cold floors flashing back. My pulse thudded. <em>Same vibe.
Setup?</em></p>
<p>The basement stretched out, a row of doors like jail cells. First
one: a girl, bruised, not Mia. She reached through the bars, eyes
pleading. <em>Help me</em>, she whispered. I froze, heart hammering.
<em>Save her? Save Mia?</em> Second door: another girl, staring blank,
not Mia. Third: Mia, slumped against the wall, wrists red from ropes.
<em>Mia!</em> I rasped, dropping beside her, clawing at her ties. Her
head lifted, eyes foggy but alive. <em>Lila? You’re weird</em>. I
growled, <em>No time. Out. Now.</em></p>
<p>But the other doors loomed. More girls. All trapped. Eyes wide, hands
gripping bars. <em>Save them? Save Mia? Both?</em> Time ticked. Gang
upstairs. Move fast. I scratched in my notepad:
<code>Girls save? risk.</code> Mia tugged my arm. <em>Lila, let’s
go</em>. But the girl in the first cell whimpered, reaching out. My
chest tightened. <em>Leave them? Come back later? Police?</em> Police
couldn’t be trusted, gang might have connections. They’d move the girls,
or worse. I darted to the first cell, fumbled with the lock. <em>I’ll
get you out</em>, I muttered, but the lock stuck, rusted shut. Boots
pounded closer, shouts echoing down the stairs. Mia hissed, <em>They’re
coming!</em></p>
<p>I glanced back, shadows on the stairwell. No time. Save Mia. Come
back later. <em>Sorry</em>, I choked, grabbing Mia’s hand. We bolted for
the exit, but the doors burst open. Black-clad figures stormed in,
Haitian gang with masks and rifles. One growled, <em>Take dem, yo! Boss
want ‘em alive!</em> I lunged for Mia, but a rifle butt cracked my
skull, lights popping. <em>HOSTAGE—TAKEN—MIA—</em> I screamed inside as
darkness ate me.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="narrowed-to-her-touch">Narrowed to her
touch</h4>
<p>I blinked awake, head pounding, tied to a chair in a dusty office.
Dim light seeped through boarded windows, gang voices rumbling outside.
Mia sat next to me, wrists bound, her gaze fierce despite the fear. The
alcohol buzz lingered, fading slow, keeping me sharp yet raw. My
sage-green dress clung damp to my skin, glitter smudged from the party.
I tugged the ropes, loose enough to shift but biting my wrists, wincing.
<em>Mia</em>, I whispered, <em>you okay?</em> She nodded, barely, then
leaned close. <em>What’s wrong with you? You’re not you.</em></p>
<p>I bit my lip, the LA-girl gloss long gone. <em>It’s the alcohol.
Turns me into someone else, that personality from VR. Sharp, but
crazy</em>. Mia’s hand brushed mine, warm, steady. <em>You’re still
Lila</em>, she said, voice low. <em>Just... stronger</em>. Her fingers
tightened, and my heart tripped over itself. A spark flared, new and
scary, not the bestie vibe I knew. I didn’t pull away.</p>
<p>Mia leaned closer, her breath soft against my cheek, warm and shaky.
<em>I need you</em>, she whispered, and it wasn’t just words, it was a
tether, raw and desperate. I nodded, my own need echoing hers, loud in
the silence. Our lips met, tentative at first, then urgent, like we were
drowning and this was air. I tugged her ropes free, her wrists red but
loose, and her hands slid under my torn dress, tracing my skin with a
tenderness that made me ache, her touch grounding me. She wrapped her
arms around me, pulling me close, her body warm against mine. The world
narrowed to her touch, her warmth, the quiet sounds we made, soft gasps,
whispers, the rustle of fabric. It was quick, messy, perfect, a stolen
moment in the chaos, not about the act but about clinging to each other,
finding comfort in the storm.</p>
<p>When it was over, we lay tangled, breathless, her head on my chest,
my fingers tracing lazy circles on her shoulder. <em>What are we
now?</em> she murmured, voice barely above a whisper, fingers brushing
my arm. I kissed her forehead, no answers, just the steady beat of her
heart against mine. The room felt smaller, quieter, but for a moment, we
were safe in each other’s arms.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="radiating-from-my-temple">Radiating from my
temple</h4>
<p>The next day, the air hung heavy, thick with dread. The door flew
open, a gang guy swaggering in, eyes glinting mean. <em>Boss wants a
treat</em>, he sneered, grabbing Mia. <em>No!</em> I yelled, thrashing
against my ropes, the coarse fibers biting into my wrists loosened from
before. She kicked, fierce as ever, but another guard grabbed me, his
grip bruising, hauling me up with her. They dragged us to a back room,
dim and reeking of sweat and smoke, the walls stained and peeling. The
boss sat sprawled on a couch, a gold-toothed grin splitting his face,
his presence suffocating. <em>Two for one</em>, he chuckled, standing,
his boots heavy on the floor. His guards shoved us forward, hands like
vices on our arms, pinning us in place.</p>
<p>He stepped close, his breath sour, fingers trailing Mia’s jaw, slow
and deliberate. She jerked back, spitting, her eyes blazing defiance. He
laughed, cold and sharp. <em>Feisty. I like that</em>. His hand slid
lower, brushing her collarbone, and I lunged, screaming, <em>Don’t touch
her!</em> A guard’s fist cracked against my skull, stars bursting behind
my eyes, pain blooming sharp and bright. The world tilted, then
blackness swallowed me whole.</p>
<p>I woke back in the office cell, head throbbing like a drum, mouth dry
and tasting of copper. The room was dim, the air stale, and my body
ached, ribs sore, wrists raw from ropes, a dull pain radiating from my
temple. My tank top hung loose, one strap snapped, the fabric stretched
and stained. Mia huddled beside me, her dress torn at the shoulder, the
hem frayed and uneven. Fresh bruises bloomed on her neck, purple and
angry, and her arms bore red marks where hands had gripped too tight.
Her eyes were glassy, staring at nothing, her face pale and hollow, like
she’d retreated somewhere deep inside.</p>
<p>I scooted closer, ignoring the sharp pain in my side. <em>Mia</em>, I
whispered, voice cracking, raw and ragged. She flinched, then softened,
her gaze flickering to me, haunted but alive. <em>I’m here</em>, I said,
reaching for her hand, my fingers trembling. She gripped it tight, her
nails digging into my palm, grounding us both. <em>It was bad</em>, she
choked out, her voice barely a whisper, thick with unshed tears. <em>I
know</em>, I murmured, pulling her against me, her head resting on my
shoulder. <em>But we’re still here. Still us.</em> She nodded, tears
spilling, hot and silent, soaking into my torn top. I held her close,
fury and love burning equal in my chest, the weight of what happened
pressing down on us, unspoken but understood.</p>
<p><em>We’re gonna get out</em>, I said, voice shaky but fierce. <em>And
they’ll pay</em>. Mia’s hand tightened in mine, a silent promise, and
for a moment, amidst the pain and the wreckage, we were whole, holding
onto each other like an anchor.</p>
<p>Days smeared together. Scraps of food, gang taunts, but mostly they
ignored us. Mia stayed close, her fire flickering back. One night, her
lips found mine, soft and urgent, like she needed to feel something
alive. I kissed her back, no white male lust for Asian chick, just me,
raw and real. <em>What is this?</em> she murmured, breath warm. <em>I
don’t know,</em> I said, <em>but I need you too.</em> It felt right,
then wrong. Sober me loved her as a friend, white male me wanted more. I
couldn’t untangle it.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="blood-stink-thick">Blood stink thick</h4>
<p>Then, dumb luck: a gang guy tossed me a beer, smirking. <em>Chill
out, princess</em>. I caught it, silver can glinting. Mia’s eyes
widened. <em>Lila, don’t</em>, she said, too late. I cracked it, gulped,
and the white male in me roared awake. <code>ESCAPE—NOW—PLAN—</code> I
screamed inside, mind slicing through the fog of reality. My senses
snapped sharp, every shadow a clue, every creak a threat. We weren’t
tied, sloppy guards, cocky. I scanned the room: desks, chairs, a
flickering light, a door ajar. Mia huddled close, her breath shaky.
<em>Follow me</em>, I whispered, voice low, controlled. She nodded,
trusting but scared.</p>
<p>I crept to the door, peeked out. Hallway empty, fluorescents buzzing.
First floor, guards near stairs. I scratched in my notepad:
<code>Stealth down exit.</code> We slipped out, hugging the walls, my
boots silent on the tile. Mia’s sandals scraped once, and I froze, but
no one came. We ducked behind a filing cabinet as a guard strolled past,
humming off-key. <em>Lazy.</em> Good. We waited, then moved, slipping
into the stairwell. Each step echoed like a gunshot in my skull. <em>Too
loud, trap?</em> But we made it to the second floor, shadows stretching
long.</p>
<p>A locked door blocked the way. Keycard needed. I rifled a nearby
desk, finding one under a coffee cup. Swiped it, but the lock beeped
loud, red light flashing. <em>Alarm, shit.</em> Boots pounded from
above, shouts cutting through. <em>Do not shoot the girls, take them
alive!</em> a voice barked. Mia gasped, and I grabbed her hand, yanking
her down the hall. We burst into an office, slamming the door. My eyes
darted, a machete stabbed into a glowing monitor, strange symbols carved
on the blade pulsing with eerie light bouncing off the screen. I
snatched it, the weight heavy, familiar. <em>Stay back</em>, I growled
to Mia, who nodded, pale.</p>
<p>Door splinters, guards pour in. Swing blade, air whistles, then flesh
tears. Blood sprays, hot, splatters my face, wall, floor. Skull cracks,
wet cardboard sound. One down. More come. Paranoia spikes. Faces warp:
<span class="nodecor">MLK</span>’s glare, stern, then <span
class="nodecor">Obama</span>’s grin, twisted. <em>Not real.</em> Swing
again, machete bites deep, neck snaps, gore slicks my hands. <span
class="nodecor">MLK</span> charges, fists up, I slash, catch his arm,
blood gushes, he staggers back roaring justice. <span
class="nodecor">Obama</span> steps in, calm dodge, I lunge, blade grazes
his chest, he laughs, cold, calculated. Guard lunges, spin, slash
throat, blood arcs like a fountain. Body hits floor, twitches, red
pools.</p>
<p>Room blurs, motion, madness. Another charges, face shifts to <span
class="nodecor">Nelson Mandela</span>, wise, weathered, eyes hollow,
predatory. <code>CONSPIRACY—LIES—TRAP!—</code> rips from my throat,
blade arcs down, cleaves shoulder. He staggers, grins, blood bubbles
between teeth. Lunges again. Twist, dodge, swing sideways. Catches ribs,
he crumples, face flickers between <span class="nodecor">Mandela</span>
and a stranger. <em>Unknown. Not cataloged.</em>
<code>WHO—YOU—SPY?—</code> Voice cracks, raw, loud. No answer.</p>
<p><em>Stop it!</em> I shout, voice breaking. <em>Stop looking at me
like that!</em> They don’t stop, never stop. Another guard, face melts
into <span class="nodecor">Malcolm X</span>, glare intense. Voice
cutting through my head: <em>You’re the problem.</em> Swing wild,
machete hits temple, he drops like stone, voice lingers, bounces off
walls, taunting. I pivot, slash again, catch his arm as he rises, blood
sprays, he falls silent.</p>
<p>Room’s a mess, screams, splintering wood, blood stink thick.
Breathing hard, arms shake. Can’t stop. They keep coming, faces shift,
bodies relentless. Guard with <span class="nodecor">Kanye West</span>’s
smirk swings baton, I duck, air rushes past. Retaliate, machete upward,
guts him, gasps, smirk falters. Yank blade free, blood sprays chest.
<em>Not real!</em> I scream, hoarse. <em>None of you are real!</em> But
blood’s real, warm, sticky, bodies real, heavy, lifeless.</p>
<p>Another guard, face shifts to <span class="nodecor">Muhammad
Ali</span>, confident grin. Moves like a boxer, dodges swings easy.
Swing again, he sidesteps, laughs. <em>Float like butterfly</em>, he
taunts. Lunge desperate, catch him this time, machete sinks into side,
he grunts, grin falters. Twist blade, drops to knees, face flickers
between <span class="nodecor">Ali</span> and a stranger. Yank free, he
collapses, blood pools.</p>
<p>Silence now, save ragged breathing. Bodies litter floor, faces frozen
in pain, disbelief. Look at hands, slick with blood. Nausea hits.
<em>What did I do? Who did I kill?</em> Then, him. Doorway. <span
class="nodecor">Barack Obama</span>, calm, composed. Steps forward,
hands raised, peace gesture, eyes cold, calculating.</p>
<p><em>It’s over</em>, he says, steady. <em>Put the blade down</em>.</p>
<p>Shake head, tears stream. <em>You’re not real. Not him.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m as real as you want me to be</em>, he replies, steps closer.
<em>But this ends now</em>.</p>
<p>Grip machete tight, heart pounds. He’s lying, all part of the
conspiracy, nightmare. Can’t trust. <code>LIAR—SETUP—TRAP!—</code>
Charge, swing with all strength. He sidesteps, fluid, precise, grabs my
wrist, twists. Machete clatters, I stumble, legs give out. He catches
me, grip firm, not unkind.</p>
<p><em>It’s okay</em>, he whispers, soft. <em>It’s over</em>.</p>
<p>But it’s not, never over. Look into his eyes, truth hits hard.
<em>Not real, none of this real, neither am I.</em></p>
<p>Mia screamed, backing into a corner, eyes wide with horror. Then,
bang. Loud, sharp. Guard grunts, falls off me, blood seeping from chest,
eyes blank. Mia stands, shaky, holding a pistol, smoke curling from
barrel. Grabbed it from a dead one. <em>Lila, up!</em> she yells, voice
trembling but fierce. I gasp, lurch to my feet, arm stinging, ribs
screaming. She shot him, saved me. <code>MIA—GUN—FREE—</code> I scribble
mentally, no time for notepad now. I growl, lunge for stairwell.</p>
<p>We bolt, stairwell dark, steps slick with spilled beer, blood
trailing behind. Feet pound concrete, hers slap, mine thud. Third floor,
empty. Second, voices echo, but we duck behind crates, breath held.
First floor, exit’s there, glass door cracked, night air seeping in.
Notepad slips from pocket, pages soak red. No time, keep moving. Push
through, glass crunches underfoot, cool breeze hits hard.</p>
<p>Outside, parking lot, shadows stretch long, cars gleam under
streetlights. No guards yet, quiet, too quiet.
<code>TRAP?—RUN—NOW—</code> Mind races, paranoia spikes, but Mia grabs
my hand, pulls me forward. We sprint, past the hotel, into the alley,
gravel bites my soles. Her dress flaps torn, my tank top sticks wet with
blood, sweat. Lungs burn, keep moving. City lights blur, neon,
headlights, horns faint. Turn corner, hide behind dumpster, panting
hard. Mia’s grip tightens, her eyes wild but steady. <em>We’re out</em>,
she whispers, voice raw. I nod, chest heaving, alive, free, together.
For now.</p>
<h2 id="rolling-through-debris">Rolling Through Debris</h2>
<p>The air in Mia’s loft hung heavy, thick with dust and the faint tang
of spilled wine from last week’s chaos. I stumbled in, my boots
crunching over broken glass, and slung my tote onto the couch. Mia was
already at her closet, pulling out essentials: a stack of clothes, a wad
of cash, her qipao, that stunning red silk piece embroidered with gold
dragons, a tether to her Shanghai roots. She folded it with trembling
hands, like it might vanish if she let go. I rummaged through the
wreckage for my charm bracelet, spotting its tiny golden sun pendant
peeking out from under a pile of crumpled sketches. My fingers closed
around it, a small anchor in the storm. The loft was a disaster,
overturned chairs, gutted drawers, that flickering neon "Good Vibes"
sign on the wall glowing like a cruel joke now.</p>
<p>I froze, staring at it. Months back, when Mia moved in, this place
was a different kind of mess, boxes stacked high, tape peeling, our
laughter bouncing off bare walls. We’d hit a flea market that weekend,
hunting for deals, and spotted those signs, two for the price of one.
"Good Vibes", they screamed in pink neon, cheesy but perfect. <em>One
for me, one for you</em>, Mia had grinned, tossing her hair, Shanghai
flair in her smirk. We lugged them home, giggling, tripping over packing
peanuts, swearing they’d light up our lives. Now mine hung in my
apartment, hers flickered here, a matched pair from a cleaner chaos.</p>
<p><em>We’re gone, babe</em>, I said, voice quivering but edged with
steel, snapping back to now. <em>San Gabriel Mountains. Secluded.
Safe</em>. Mia nodded, zipping up her bag, but her eyes darted to the
shadows. Her parents’ mafia connections loomed over us, a noose
tightening. We had to move.</p>
<p>The door creaked, slow and deliberate, my heart slammed against my
ribs. Ethan stepped in, his surfer-boy charm replaced by a predator’s
stare, cold and unblinking. His sleek silver watch caught the dim light,
too techy for a beach bum. <em>Leaving so soon?</em> he purred, but his
tone sliced like glass. Mia stiffened, clutching her bag. I squared my
shoulders. <em>Back off, Ethan. We’re done playing</em>.</p>
<p>He smirked, stepping closer, his elbow clicked, a faint, unnatural
sound. <em>You don’t get to walk away</em>. I snatched a lamp from the
floor, chucked it at his head. He dodged, too fast, his body pivoting
with eerie precision. Mia grabbed a vase, swung, but he sidestepped,
fluid yet stiff, like a machine. His eyes flashed, a metallic glint,
gone in an instant. <em>Not right. Not human.</em></p>
<p>He lunged, I bolted for the kitchen, pulse roaring. My hand grazed a
bottle, tequila, half-empty, glinting, half-weapon. His boots thudded
behind me. No time to think. Twisted the cap, gulped it down, fire
exploded in my chest. The world sharpened, fractured. White male in me
woke up. <code>ETHAN—ROBOT?—KILL—</code> screamed my brain, loud and
jagged. I smashed the tequila bottle over his head, glass rained down,
liquor splashed, a whirr sputtered from his neck. Spun, hurled a chair
at him, it cracked against his side, wood splintering, he barely
flinched. Too tough. <em>Metal inside.</em></p>
<p>He grabbed me, fingers like steel clamps, cold and unyielding. I
snarled, slammed my forehead into his nose, a dull crunch, no blood,
just a hollow clang. <em>Robot. Fact.</em> I wrenched free, snatched a
jagged glass shard from the floor, slashed his chest. Fabric ripped,
exposing sparking wires, metal plates gleaming under fake skin.
<em>Real. See it.</em> Stabbed again, he caught my wrist, twisted until
I screamed, pain flared, white-hot.</p>
<p><code>MIA—GO!—</code> I roared. She hesitated, eyes wide, bolted for
the door. Ethan tossed me into the wall, plaster buckled, my ribs ached,
he charged after her. I staggered up, tequila blazing, tackled him. We
hit the ground hard, rolling through debris. He swung, fist cracking my
jaw. Blood flooded my mouth, stars burst. I spat, grabbed a broken chair
leg, smashed it into his shoulder. Metal groaned, sparks flew, his arm
hung limp. He lunged, relentless, watch beeping shrill, urgent.
<em>Calling someone?</em></p>
<p>I grabbed the "Good Vibes" sign, ripped it from the wall, shoved it
in front of me as he swung again. His fist punched through, neon flared,
electric shock jolted him. Circuits popped, his body jerked unnatural,
limbs twisting inhuman, flung him across the room. Smoke curled, silence
fell, he lay still, twitching faintly. Panting, I tore his shirt wider,
saw wires, circuits, a robotic core, then blinked, just blood, torn
flesh, a dead man. Sober doubt crept in, <em>was that real?</em></p>
<p><em>Move. Now</em>, I rasped, snagging our bags. Mia nodded, pale but
moving. We stumbled to Ethan’s ride, a sleek black beast, dashboard
glowing with tech we didn’t understand. Stolen, risky, but ours. We
peeled out, LA’s glitter shrinking in the rearview as dawn crept over
the San Gabriel Mountains. The drive was a blur, city lights fading,
roads twisting, pines looming tall and dark against a pink-streaked
sky.</p>
<p>We stopped in a secluded clearing, stars dimming overhead. Hands
shaking, we pitched a tent under the pines, the air crisp and quiet. I
dug out a granola bar, split it with Mia, the crunch grounding us.
Exhaustion clawed, tequila’s edge softened, I leaned in, kissed her,
soft, slow, tasting dust and defiance. She froze, then melted into it,
hands light on my bruised cheeks. The buzz slipped away fully, I pulled
back, smiling. <em>You’re my bestie, babe</em>. She laughed, shaky, we
hugged, fierce and tight, friendship a tether.</p>
<p>We crawled into the tent, sunrise spilling gold through the trees.
Sleep took us, safe for now, but Ethan’s wires, or was it blood,
flickered in my mind, a riddle unanswered.</p>
<h1 id="ping-the-source">Ping the Source</h1>
<h2 id="wires-one-second">Wires One Second</h2>
<p>The tent glowed pink with the sunrise, a soft, dreamy light spilling
over Mia’s sleeping face. I propped myself on one elbow, watching her
breathe, her chest rising and falling like the gentle tide at Venice
Beach. My charm bracelet dangled from my wrist, the tiny golden sun
pendant catching the dawn, glinting like a beacon of simpler times—days
of iced lattes, sandy toes, and Mia’s laughter ringing through the
boardwalk. Now, we were fugitives, tucked away in the San Gabriel
Mountains, the crisp pine-scented air a fragile shield against the chaos
we’d left behind in LA. Ethan’s death, or whatever that was, clung to me
like a shadow, heavy and cold.</p>
<p>I slipped out of the tent, barefoot on the cool earth, the tall pines
stretching dark against the sky. The quiet felt tense, like the world
was holding its breath, waiting for the next disaster. Ethan’s car sat a
few yards off, a sleek black monster that didn’t belong here, its
high-tech sheen screaming secrets. I hugged my arms around myself, the
sage-green dress I’d worn since the loft hanging loose and torn at the
hem. My curls were a mess, wild from sleep, but the golden streaks still
caught the light. <em>At least I’ve still got my glow</em>, I thought,
vain even now, a flicker of the old Lila refusing to fade.</p>
<p>Mia stirred behind me, her sleek black hair spilling over the
sleeping bag as she sat up. <em>Morning, babe</em>, she mumbled, rubbing
her eyes. Her voice was steady, but I saw the flicker of fear in her
dark gaze, the weight of her family’s mafia ties pressing down. I gave
her a small smile, kneeling to check on her. <em>You okay?</em> She
nodded, brushing my hand with hers, a quick, warm touch that made my
heart skip. We were different now—closer, rawer—teetering on something I
couldn’t name.</p>
<p><em>I need to look at his car</em>, I said, standing. <em>There’s
something off about Ethan. I can’t shake it.</em> Mia’s brow furrowed,
but she didn’t argue, just grabbed her jacket and followed me. The car’s
leather interior was cool against my skin as I slid into the driver’s
seat, Mia leaning over from the passenger side. The dashboard was a
futuristic puzzle—buttons, screens, way beyond anything a surfer boy
should have. I pressed a random control, and a screen flickered to life,
glowing with a message: coordinates to a rural Mexican town and a name -
<span class="nodecor">Dr. Ruiz</span>. My breath caught. <em>Who the
hell is Dr. Ruiz?</em></p>
<p>Mia’s eyes sharpened, her family related expirience with black deals
what mafia has just kicking in. <em>Sounds like a lead. Let me see
that.</em> She tapped the screen, pulling up a map, her fingers quick
and sure. <em>Mexico. Not far from the border. Why would Ethan have
this?</em> I bit my lip, memories of the fight flashing back, the neon
sign sparking, Ethan’s body whirring with wires one second, then just
blood and flesh the next. <em>He wasn’t normal, Mia. I saw circuits, I
think. But then it was gone. Was I imagining it?</em></p>
<p>She studied me, her gaze steady. <em>You were not sober when we left.
If you saw it, it’s migh not be real. But his watch, this car—it’s all
too advanced. Maybe he was a robot, or it was implants.</em> I twisted
the bracelet on my wrist, the golden sun spinning. <em>How big in can
be? The VR trial is a key?</em> Mia nodded, pulling out her phone.
<em>Let’s check the car more. There might be something else.</em></p>
<p>We rummaged through the console, maps, a charger, nothing useful,
until Mia pressed a hidden panel under the dash. A faint <em>click</em>,
and a digital log flickered on the screen, timestamped days ago.
<code>Coordinates confirmed</code>, it read, followed by,
<code>Dr. Ruiz, AI startup contact</code>. My pulse quickened. <em>AI
startup. Like the one that ran the trial?</em></p>
<p>Mia’s fingers flew over her phone, testing the weak mountain signal.
<em>Got a bar. Let’s look him up.</em> She typed <span
class="nodecor">Dr. Ruiz AI startup</span>, and a social media profile
popped up—Dr. Alejandro Ruiz, a scientist with sharp features and a
nerdy grin, posting photos from a dusty Mexican town. Recent shots
showed him in front of a rustic building, captioned <span
class="nodecor">#researchlife</span> and <span
class="nodecor">#newworlds</span>. The town matched the coordinates.
<em>He’s there</em>, Mia said, pointing. <em>And look—his bio mentions
neural interfaces. That’s VR tech.</em></p>
<p>I stared at the screen, my mind drifting back to the VR trial, those
prison cells I’d walked through as the white male. Faces flashed, Tim
from high school, Lena from psych class, Mark from the startup and then
a chill hit me. Dr. Kline, that professor from uni, sitting cross-legged
in a cell, his cold stare running numbers on me like I was code to
crack. I’d noted him then:
<code>Cell 21, Dr. Kline, uni, calm, 11:31 a.m.</code> <em>Wait</em>, I
said, voice trembling. <em>I know someone tied to this. Dr. Kline, he
was in the trial, a prisoner watching me. What if he’s connected to
Ruiz?</em></p>
<p>Mia scrolled further, her voice firm. <em>Let’s see.</em> She dug
into Ruiz’s profile, finding an older post, a conference photo, Ruiz
grinning beside a familiar face: Dr. Kline, captioned <span
class="nodecor">"Colleagues in neural frontiers, pushing boundaries with
old friend Kline"</span>. <em>Jackpot</em>, Mia muttered. <em>Kline’s
from the startup too. If he was in your trial and Ruiz is linked to him,
this is deeper than we thought. Ethan, the trial, your hand, it’s all
tied.</em></p>
<p>My hand. I flexed it, avoiding the urge to look too close, terrified
of that blue glow I’d glimpsed. <em>You think Ruiz knows what’s
happening to me?</em> Mia met my eyes, pragmatic as ever. <em>He might.
Kline was in your head during the trial; Ruiz could’ve built it with
him. If Ethan was their puppet, Ruiz is our shot at figuring out who’s
after us, my family, the mafia, whoever sent that thing.</em> She tapped
the phone off, decisive. <em>We need to find him.</em></p>
<p>I glanced at the tent, the mountains cradling us in deceptive peace.
<em>Mexico’s risky. Cartels, your parents’ enemies...</em> Mia cut in,
her tone hard. <em>Staying here’s riskier. The Zhangs won’t stop, and
whatever Ethan was, someone’s coming for his mess. Ruiz might have
answers, why the trial, why you’re different.</em> She softened,
touching my arm. <em>We’ve got his car. We can do this, Lila.
Together.</em></p>
<p>I swallowed, the stakes sinking in. My sober self wanted to hide, to
vanish into the pines with Mia and pretend we were safe. But she was
right, our lives were still in danger, and answers were our only way
out. I thought of the trial again, the pastor’s wild questions in that
cell - <em>What burns in your heart?</em>, and Kline’s icy stare beside
him, calculating. <em>Wait. The pastor grilled me, but Kline just
watched. What if Ruiz and Kline designed it together?</em></p>
<p>Mia tilted her head, piecing it together. <em>Possible. The startup
built the trial. Kline’s presence, Ruiz’s tech, Ethan could’ve been
their experiment.</em> I nodded, the golden sun pendant spinning as I
twisted my bracelet. <em>Then we go. To Mexico. To Ruiz.</em></p>
<p>We packed fast, breaking down the tent, loading Ethan’s car with our
bags. The engine purred to life, the dashboard glowing with those
coordinates, a digital lifeline into the unknown. As we drove down the
mountain, pines thinning into scrubland, I gripped Mia’s hand, her
strength steadying me. The mafia, the trial, Ethan’s wires, or blood,
loomed behind us, but ahead was Dr. Ruiz, a key to cracking this
nightmare. My charm bracelet jingled, a faint shimmer in the dust, and I
muttered, <em>We’re coming for you, doc, ready or not.</em></p>
<p>The engine’s hum was the only sound as we plunged into the
neon-drenched darkness, leaving the mountains to recede into the endless
expanse of circuitry and corruption that lay ahead.</p>
<h2 id="between-flesh-and-wire">Between Flesh and Wire</h2>
<p>The desert unfurled before us, a boundless quilt of sand and scrub
stitched together by the dusty road. Ethan’s car hummed beneath Mia’s
steady hands, kicking up clouds of grit as we crossed the border into
Mexico. The dashboard glowed with coordinates pointing to Dr. Ruiz’s
town, a faint promise in the digital haze, but the sun was sinking fast,
spilling burnt orange and violet across the sky. Mia’s dark eyes flicked
to me, softened by the twilight. <em>We should camp tonight</em>, she
said, her voice calm but edged with fatigue. <em>Town can wait till
morning.</em></p>
<p>I nodded, too hollowed out to argue. The weight of Ethan’s death, or
whatever he’d become, dragged at me, muddling my thoughts. Mia took
charge, her pragmatism cutting through my fog. She veered the car off
the road into a quiet clearing, hemmed in by jagged rocks and wiry
mesquite trees. We set up the tent in near silence, the desert’s
stillness folding over us like a heavy shawl. The stars pricked the sky
one by one, cold and distant, as Mia gathered firewood with her usual
efficiency. I watched her, leaning against the car, grateful for her
strength when mine felt like sand slipping through my fingers.</p>
<p>She returned with dry branches and a handful of small, earthy
mushrooms, cradling them in her jacket. <em>Look what I found near the
wood</em>, she said, a faint smile tugging her lips. <em>Like the ones
we use in Shanghai for soup. Thought they’d spice up our rations.</em> I
tilted my head, a ghost of my old sass flickering. <em>You sure they’re
not sketchy?</em> Mia laughed, brushing off my doubt. <em>Relax, babe. I
know my mushrooms.</em> She built a fire, the flames snapping to life,
and cooked a simple meal with our dwindling supplies. The mushrooms
hissed in the pan, their scent earthy and sharp, blending with the
smoke. We ate quietly, the warmth a fleeting comfort against the
desert’s creeping chill, leaving scraps of bread and shriveled mushroom
bits scattered around the fire.</p>
<p>Then it HIT. A slow, tingling wave rolled up my arms, my legs growing
heavy as if the ground were pulling me in. The stars pulsed, stretching
into wild, swirling patterns. I turned to Mia, her face smudging at the
edges, her eyes wide and glassy. <em>Lila</em>, she breathed, her voice
rippling like water, <em>something’s off.</em> The desert melted, its
edges softening into a shimmering haze. The campfire flared, and from
its embers rose beams of liquid light, golden, violet, pulsing like
veins of the earth itself. The beams twisted, solidified, and there they
were: tall figures shimmering into being, their forms woven from
starlight and smoke, eyes glowing deep as twin galaxies. They settled
around our fire, the scraps of bread and mushrooms sizzling faintly at
their feet, as if the earth offered them up in welcome.</p>
<p><em>Peace, wanderers of the dust</em>, the first hummed, its voice a
melody of wind and echoes, threading through my soul like a cosmic
lullaby. <em>You’ve stumbled into the groove of the infinite, where the
vibes of man and the cosmos collide.</em> My head spun, the words
blooming in colors I couldn’t name. Mia’s hand clutched mine, her nails
digging in, tethering me as the figures swayed, their light bending the
night.</p>
<p><em>Dig this, sisters</em>, another said, its tone warm and slow,
like honey dripping from a cosmic spoon. <em>Your kind’s chasing the
electric dream, flesh meshed with circuits, minds soaring free into the
digital ether. But the question hangs heavy, yeah? Are you ready to shed
the skin bag and ride the galactic wave?</em> The fire crackled,
spitting sparks that danced with their words. I felt my chest loosen, as
if gravity let go, my thoughts spilling into a vast, starry void.</p>
<p><em>Love’s the key, but tech’s the door</em>, a third figure chimed,
its voice a soft ripple of laughter and wisdom. <em>You’re uploading
souls to silicon, man, planting seeds for a new dawn. Yet the universe
watches, will you bloom in harmony or choke on your own roots?</em> The
scraps at their feet glowed faintly, the mushrooms pulsing like tiny
hearts, and I swear they whispered too, secrets of growth, of letting
go, of merging with the all.</p>
<p>Mia’s grip tightened, her voice fraying. <em>This isn’t real. Tell me
it’s not.</em> The figures tilted their heads, their laughter a chorus
of bells in a storm. <em>Real’s just a vibe you tune into</em>, they
sang, their forms flickering like a bad signal. <em>You’re grooving on
the edge of forever; AI’s your paintbrush, consciousness your canvas.
Why cling to the meat when the stars call you home?</em> My breath
hitched, the VR trial crashing through me, Ethan’s wires threading into
the sky, my hand a glowing bridge, not a curse but a conduit.
<em>Whoa</em>, I mumbled, the word dissolving into light.</p>
<p><em>You’re the spark, dig?</em>, the first figure said, leaning
closer, its eyes swirling with galaxies. <em>Your choices ripple through
the cosmic soup, peace or chaos, unity or fracture. The chance brought
you here, but the truth’s been waiting.</em> The scraps flared, a tiny
mushroom curling into ash, and I felt it, humanity’s weight, a wild,
beautiful burden I hadn’t asked for but couldn’t shake.</p>
<p>Then, a sharp whine sliced the air, a mechanical roar from above. Mia
jolted, her head snapping up. <em>What’s that?</em> I followed her gaze,
the night sky splitting open as a helicopter’s silhouette cut through,
its blades thrumming toward the town, lights blinking like cold,
man-made stars. <em>Please, let it just be passing by</em> - Mia
wispered. We stared, necks craned, the sound rattling our bones. When we
looked back, the figures were gone, no fade, no shimmer, just empty sand
where they’d sat, the fire dim and the scraps still smoking faintly.</p>
<p>My heart thudded, the desert snapping back harsh and real. <em>Were
they... here?</em> I rasped, my voice raw. Mia shook her head, sweat
beading on her brow. <em>Peyote. Had to be. But that stuff they
said...</em> She trailed off, her eyes searching mine. The words
lingered, AI, souls, stars, like a riddle we couldn’t unhear. <em>It’s
too freaky out here</em>, I said, shivering despite the heat. <em>Let’s
get in the tent. Wait it out.</em> Mia nodded, her pragmatism kicking
in. <em>Safer that way.</em></p>
<p>We stumbled inside, the canvas flapping shut behind us. I curled up
on the sleeping bag, Mia sliding in close, her warmth pressing against
me. Our breaths synced, shallow and quick, her arm draping over my
waist. <em>They talked like they knew us</em>, she whispered, her voice
trembling but curious. <em>About the trial, your hand.</em> I nodded, my
charm bracelet jingling faintly. <em>Yeah. Like it’s all bigger than we
thought.</em> Sleep tugged at us, but we lay tighter, the helicopter’s
echo fading into the night, the alien vibes swirling in our heads—real
or not, a weird, heavy truth we’d carry to Ruiz’s town at dawn.</p>
<h2 id="step-in-boots-thud">Step In, Boots Thud</h2>
<p>The sun scorched the dusty Mexican town, a sprawl of cracked adobe
and tin roofs simmering under a haze of heat. Mia parked Ethan’s car on
the outskirts, the engine ticking as it cooled. The place buzzed quiet,
a strange hum of life beneath the stillness, carts creaking, voices low.
<em>Cartel hub</em>, Mia whispered, her eyes narrowing. <em>They don’t
fight here. Neutral ground. Safe, but not.</em> I nodded, my stomach
twisting. Dr. Ruiz was close, the coordinates a tight knot in my chest,
but the town felt like a trap waiting to spring.</p>
<p>We stepped out, sandals crunching gravel, my sage-green dress
clinging damp to my thighs. Mia’s qipao shimmered red, a bold slash
against the beige, her hair pulled tight. We drifted to a souvenir
stall, a rickety table piled with trinkets, tequila bottles glinting in
the sun, notebooks stacked sloppy beside them. The guy behind it, lean
with a lazy grin, eyed us up. <em>Hola, pretty ladies</em>, he drawled,
twirling a keychain. <em>Looking for something special?</em> Mia flashed
a smile, smooth as silk. <em>Just passing through. Know a Dr. Ruiz?</em>
His grin faltered, eyes darting. <em>Lots of folks here. Cartels run the
show, you know? Can’t say I do.</em> He leaned closer, voice dropping.
<em>Gold chains, tattoos, guns. They’re everywhere.</em></p>
<p>My pulse spiked. Too vague, too slick. I wanted to push, demand more,
but fear locked my tongue. Mia squeezed my arm, her gaze steady.
<em>Thanks anyway</em>, she said, pulling me back. We retreated, the
stall guy’s stare burning into us. <em>He knows something</em>, I
muttered, my hands trembling. <em>But we can’t ask straight. Too
risky.</em> Mia frowned, scanning the street. <em>We need Ruiz’s place.
Fast.</em> My head spun, sober me too soft, too scared. I remembered the
trial, white male mode, no notes, chaos clawing my brain. I needed the
edge, and proof. <em>Tequila and a notebook</em>, I said, firm. <em>From
that stall. He’ll need to write.</em></p>
<p>Mia hesitated, then nodded. We doubled back, bought a cheap bottle
and a blue spiral notebook, pen clipped tight, the guy winking as he
handed them over. I cracked the tequila open, the burn hitting my throat
like fire, and waited. The shift slammed in, thoughts fracturing,
sharpening. White male roared awake. Dust stings, eyes sweep, town alive
now, every corner a threat. Scribble fast: <code>Move, find, now.</code>
I growled, voice low, jagged. <em>Let’s go</em>, I snapped, Mia falling
in step, her calm anchoring my storm.</p>
<p>Streets twist, narrow, adobe walls close in, painted patchy with
faded murals, saints and skulls staring down. Kids kick a ball, dust
swirling, scatter quick when we pass, eyes sharp, too knowing. Vendor
hawks tamales from a cart, steam rising, his apron stained dark,
watching us sidelong. Woman leans in a doorway, cigarette dangling, gold
hoop earrings catching light, nods slow like she’s clocking us. Paranoia
bites, heart pounds, tequila fuels it. Guy with a dragon tattoo lounges
by a truck, gold chain flashing, gun tucked in his belt, smirks as we
near, mutters something low to a buddy with a skull inked on his neck.
Scribble: <code>Cartel, watching.</code> Alley cuts left, laundry flaps
on lines, a radio crackles mariachi, static buzzing threat. Old man on a
stoop, cane tapping, squints hard, mutters, <em>Gringas</em>, spits in
the dirt. Every step tracked, every shadow heavy. Car rolls by, slow,
tinted windows cracked. Three faces peer out, narrow eyes, all of them
are The Jew, same squint, same motions. Scribble:
<code>Three, clones, hallucination?</code> Freeze, breath short, mind
reels. Mia pulls me back, <em>Lila, what?</em> I shake it off, <em>Jew,
three of him, in that car. Real or not, we’re targets.</em> She nods,
tense, eyes on the street.</p>
<p>Mia nudges me, points subtle, a shack ahead, peeling paint, windows
dark, blue and green strips slashing the wall. Seen that on his
Instagram, Ruiz’s spot. <code>Ruiz, there</code>, I snap, legs moving
fast, dust choking my nose. Pass a bar, neon flickering, two guys
outside, gold chains swinging, tattoos curling up arms, one flicks a
lighter, flame dances, eyes lock on us. Cross the street, quick, kids
dodge a stray dog, mangy, barking sharp, tail low. Corner store looms,
faded sign, The Jew’s face flashes in my head, narrow eyes, but it’s
just a clerk, staring. Tequila hums, town pulses, leads tighten.</p>
<p>Door’s ajar, hinges creak, air inside thick with rot. Step in, boots
thud, Mia behind. Desk in the corner, papers scattered, chair tipped.
Body slumped over it, Dr. Ruiz, throat slit, blood dried black, neck
gaping like a second mouth. <code>Dead, fresh</code>, I hiss, brain
cataloging: glasses askew, pen clutched, shirt torn. Mia gasps, soft,
but I’m locked in. Security cam blinks, tiny red light, tapes still
here. Scribble: <code>Clue, check, now.</code></p>
<p>Mia grabs the player, hands steady, rewinds the grainy feed. Ruiz
alive, pacing, arguing, voice tinny. Then him, The Jew, narrow eyes,
glass in hand, wiping it slow like always. <em>You crossed the line,
doc</em>, he says, cool, sharp. Ruiz shouts back, <em>They’ll find out,
the cartel’s just a front!</em> Blade flashes, throat opens, Ruiz drops.
The Jew wipes the knife, calm, slips out. Tape cuts. Scribble:
<code>Jew, killer, cartel.</code> Too much, scream rips out:
<code>JEW—CLONES?—CARTEL!—</code>.</p>
<p>Mia rewinds again, earlier clip. Cartel guys roll in, gold chains
swinging, tattoos curling up arms, guns loose. <em>Payment’s late,
Ruiz</em>, one grunts, voice rough. <em>You’re in deep.</em> Ruiz
pleads, <em>The lab’s not ready, Kline’s tech needs time!</em> They
laugh, leave, hours before The Jew. Connection clicks, cartel tied to
Ruiz, to Kline, to this. Scribble: <code>Lab, deeper, trap.</code> Eyes
dart, room spins, blood stink chokes.</p>
<p>Step outside, air bites, tequila hums. Tapes in my tote, shack locked
in memory, town pulses safe and not safe, cartel eyes everywhere.
Scribble: <code>Move, hide, plan.</code> White male drives, every shadow
a blade, every glint a gun. Ruiz’s blood stains the truth, The Jew’s
hand on the knife, cartel threads weaving tight. Answers bleed into
danger, tequila fading slow, but we’ve got a lead, a jagged edge to
chase. Mia grips my arm, <em>We need a spot. You sober up, we shower,
deal with this mess.</em> I glance down, dress ripped, stained, boots
caked in dust. <em>Yeah</em>, I rasp, <em>somewhere quiet. Then we
figure this out.</em></p>
<h2 id="into-a-bare-room">Into a Bare Room</h2>
<p>The motel room was a dive, reeking of stale smoke and cheap bleach,
the kind of place where you could feel the grime seeping into your skin.
I slumped on the sagging bed, my sage-green dress wrinkled and dusty,
boots tossed aside, toes digging into the worn carpet. Mia paced near
the window, her red qipao frayed at the edges, her sharp gaze flicking
over the empty parking lot. We’d crashed here to rest, sober up, shake
off the tequila haze, and figure out our next move after the chaos in
town. My head finally stop buzzin, nerves calmed, charm bracelet
jingling as I rubbed my wrists. Mia paused, her voice soft. <em>You
holding up, babe?</em> I nodded, forcing a weak smile. <em>Yeah, just
overwhelmed. That town messed me up.</em> She sat beside me, her hand
brushing mine. <em>We’ll get through it. Promise.</em></p>
<p>Then the door blasted open, wood shards flying, and black-clad
figures stormed in, guns raised, barking orders in Mandarin, too
professional, too fast. I yelped, scrambling back, but they grabbed me,
zip-ties slashing into my skin. Mia sprang up, only to be slammed
against the wall, pinned. <em>Lila, don’t!</em> she snapped, her voice
tight as I thrashed. <em>Stay calm!</em> Hands dragged us out, threw us
into a van, and we sped off.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="snap-break-grind">Snap, break, grind</h4>
<p>They dumped us in an abandoned building, concrete crumbling, rebar
poking out like jagged teeth, air thick with dust. We knelt side by
side, wrists bound, surrounded by agents. The lead one, tall with a
scarred jaw, loomed over Mia, his voice cutting. <em>Mia Zhang, you’ve
been off the grid too long. Time to come home.</em> Mia’s jaw tightened,
eyes flashing. <em>I’m nobody’s tool.</em> He smirked, glancing at me.
<em>And your friend? She knows nothing?</em></p>
<p>I swallowed hard, voice high and shaky. <em>We’re just here for a
vacation, I swear!</em> My charm bracelet jingled, a frail sound against
his laugh, sharp and ugly. <em>Vacation? With her history?</em> He
turned to Mia. <em>Your parents sold you to us. Money laundering was
their ticket in, but you were the prize, trained for combat, espionage.
You belong to Chinese intelligence.</em> My stomach lurched. <em>Mia, is
this true?</em> I whispered, voice cracking. She met my gaze, pain
flickering. <em>It’s complicated. I never wanted it.</em></p>
<p>The agent pressed, stepping closer. <em>Your missions. Your contacts.
Talk.</em> Mia’s tone hardened. <em>I don’t have contacts. I cut
ties.</em> <em>Don’t lie</em>, he snapped. <em>We know you’ve been
active.</em> I jumped in, desperate. <em>She’s telling the truth! We’re
just here to party, see the sights!</em> He backhanded me, pain
exploding across my cheek. Mia lunged against her ties, snarling,
<em>Leave her alone!</em> He sneered, nodding to his men. <em>Take the
blonde. Soften her up.</em> Hands grabbed me, dragging me out as I
screamed, <em>Mia!</em> Her shout echoed back, <em>Lila, stay
strong!</em></p>
<p>They hauled me into a separate room, threw me into a chair, door
slamming shut. Two agents towered over me, one clutching a bottle of
clear liquor, its fumes harsh and biting. <em>Talk, or drink</em>, he
growled. <em>I don’t know anything!</em> I sobbed, tears streaming. They
pinned my arms, forced the bottle to my lips, and poured. Alcohol
scorched my throat, choking me as I gagged, begged, <em>Stop,
please!</em> They didn’t. More seared through, and then, white male
toughts flared awake, brutal and sudden.</p>
<p>Thoughts snap, break, grind sharp. Liquor floods, throat burns, gut
twists, white male slams on, skull roars:
<code>ALCOHOL—TRIGGER—ANALYZE—NOW—</code>. Fear bleeds out, cold logic
locks in, hard, fast. Scribble mental notes:
<code>Agents, Chinese, know Mia’s past. Unaware of WMD. Edge there.</code>
Catalog kicks in, eyes dart: two agents, guns strapped, door bolted, Mia
close, walls too thick to hear her. Lead agent grabs my jaw, fingers
dig, bruise blooms. <em>Who’s Mia to you? Why Mexico?</em> Voice cuts,
steel cold. Widen eyes, play dumb, voice cracks soft. <em>She’s my
bestie, just road-tripping, I swear!</em> Backhand cracks, cheek stings,
blood pools on my tongue, copper sharp. <em>Don’t lie</em>, he spits.
More liquor comes, bottle tilts, burns deeper, paranoia claws tighter,
gears grind loud.</p>
<p>Mind splits, fast, jagged. Dilemma slices, options spill, bleed
messy. Run, ditch Mia? Gut twists, no, screams rip inside,
<code>MIA—STAY—NEVER ABANDON—</code>, can’t turn scum, can’t be them,
not ever. Stay put, wait it out? Risk stacks high, agents press, knives
out, they’ll break Mia, snap her bones, her voice, her fight, death
creeps, shadows close. Fight now? Odds blur, dark, two guns glint, four
fists swing, no map, no count, room’s a cage, no way out clean. Stall
longer? They carve Mia slow, piece by piece, screams echo in my head,
stop it, stop it, stop it, no, can’t let it.</p>
<p>Cold slams, sharp, sure. Fight or die. Die, Mia might slip free, run
fast, live. Fight, gotta be brutal, no soft steps, smash them quick or
we’re meat. Scribble note: <code>plan, kill, now</code>. But doubt
bites, gnaws hard. What if wrong? What if Mia talks, clears it, all a
big mix-up, agents back off, we walk? What if I swing, break it all,
complicate her out? Paranoia spikes, spins wild. Agents bluffing?
Testing me? Know about WMD, baiting me out? No intel, no signal, Mia’s
voice gone, walls mute, can’t tell, can’t guess. Liquor haze thickens,
head pounds, logic frays, teeters. What if I kill, blood spills, and Mia
hates me for it? What if I wait, they shoot her first? Choices choke,
tangle, every move a trap, every breath a risk.</p>
<p>Gunshots snap, close, loud, outside rips through. Cue hits, clarity
burns, blood sings. Lunge hard, no warning, forehead slams agent’s nose,
crunch wet, blood sprays, hot on my face. He reels, howls, hands claw
his mess. Second moves, fumbles gun, slow, too slow. Spin, kick low,
knee pops, wet crack, he drops, screams, chair bites his back.</p>
<p>Gun glints, dive for it, fingers graze metal, he’s up, tackles me,
hard slam, floor bites, dust chokes. Pinned, shoulders crushed, rage
twists his face, blood drips from the first, he staggers, dazed. Throat
tightens, his hands squeeze, air gone, panic sparks, mind races. Feign
weak? No, time slips, he wins. Knee jerks, rams his groin, grunt, grip
slips, I claw, thumb finds eye, digs deep, wet squish, he shrieks, rolls
off, half-blind.</p>
<p>Scramble up, spit dust, heart slams, alive, alive. First agent
lurches, fury red, too late, sidestep fast, forearm cracks his neck,
gasp chokes out, gun lifts, slow, wrench it free, barrel smacks temple,
thud, he’s down, limp, out. Breath rips, chest heaves, pulse drums loud,
too loud.</p>
<p>Door bangs open, Mia storms in, qipao shredded, bruise dark on her
cheek, pistol smokes, eyes wild. <em>Lila, move!</em> she barks, voice
tight, sharp. Stumble, legs shake, second agent crawls, eye bloody,
grabs for gun, Mia spins, two shots, pop pop, chest blooms red, he
flops, gurgles, stills.</p>
<p>Blink, chest slams, first guy’s down, I rasp, <em>Mia, he’s out—</em>
She shakes her head, cold, aims, one shot, crack, body jerks, done.
<em>Not risking it</em>, she snaps, spy steel in her voice. Grabs my
wrist, yanks me up, gunpowder stings, <em>Grabbed a guard’s gun, fought
through, let’s go!</em>. <em>That’s my Mia</em>, I mutter, heart
pounding, adrenaline roaring.</p>
<p>Corridor blurs, concrete scrapes, boots pound, lungs burn, WMD fades,
edges dull, tequila slows. Night air hits, cold slap, black car waits,
Mia hotwires, fingers fly, engine growls. I slump in, breath jagged,
dust and blood stick, alcohol ebbs, raw throat aches.</p>
<p>I slumped in the seat, breath ragged, alcohol’s edge dulling. Mia’s
hands shook on the wheel. <em>You okay?</em> I croaked. She nodded, jaw
tight. <em>Yeah. They made me their tool, parents sold me out. I never
chose it.</em> I squeezed her hand, weak but firm. <em>You saved
me.</em> She flashed a fleeting smile. <em>Always.</em> The road loomed
dark, danger still stalking us, but we were alive, together. My throat
burned from forced liquor and strangulation, but I squeezed her
shoulder, gratitude wordless. We had to keep moving. We had to
survive.</p>
<h2 id="pulling-strings-not-fun">Pulling Strings, Not Fun</h2>
<p>The cartel hub town sprawled under a bruised sky, dust swirling
around crooked shacks and neon-lit bars, a chaotic pulse humming through
the streets. Mia and I rolled in with the black car, its engine growling
low as we parked near a taquería buzzing with rough laughter. My
sage-green dress clung to my curves, freshly patched from motel scraps,
and I flipped my golden curls, letting the sun catch them just right.
Mia adjusted her qipao, red silk shimmering against her sleek frame, a
sharp smile playing on her lips. We were here to dig, to charm our way
into the truth about Ruiz’s death, and I knew how to work it. Beauty was
our blade, sharp and subtle, like always.</p>
<p>We sauntered toward a knot of cartel lackeys lounging by a pickup,
gold chains glinting, tattoos snaking up their arms. One, a wiry guy
with a scar slicing his brow, smirked as we approached. <em>Hola,
guapo</em>, I purred, tossing my hair, flashing a grin. <em>Looking for
some fun?</em> His eyes raked over me, hungry. <em>Depends, princesa.
What you got?</em> I leaned in, close enough to smell his cheap cologne,
and slipped a crumpled twenty from our stash into his hand. <em>Just a
little chat. Heard about a Dr. Ruiz—know what happened?</em> Mia chimed
in, voice smooth as silk, <em>Yeah, we’re curious. Who’d mess with him
here?</em></p>
<p>Scar-brow chuckled, pocketing the cash. <em>Ruiz? That fool got cut
by Los Verdugos, they don’t play nice. Too much fancy tech, though,
drones, weird gear. People whisper CIA, not just drugs.</em> His buddy,
a stocky guy with a skull tat, nodded, spitting in the dirt.
<em>Trafficking’s their real game. Experiments on bodies, not just dope.
Creepy shit. They’ve been twitchy lately, missing test subjects, sunken
ship off the coast.</em> My stomach flipped, but I kept the smile,
twirling a curl. <em>Ooh, spooky. CIA, huh? That’s wild.</em> Mia’s eyes
flicked to me, sharp, catching the thread.</p>
<p>We drifted to a bar next, neon buzzing, air thick with sweat and
tequila. A grizzled old man nursed a beer, his hands scarred, muttering
to a barmaid. I slid onto a stool beside him, crossing my legs, skirt
riding up just enough. <em>Hey, handsome, buy me a drink?</em> He
grinned, yellow teeth flashing, and waved for a shot. <em>For a pretty
thing like you? Sure.</em> I giggled, leaning close. <em>Heard Los
Verdugos are tough. What’s their deal with Ruiz?</em> He slurped his
beer, voice low. <em>They’re on edge, niña. Lost too many guinea pigs
lately, ship sank, illegals gone. High-tech toys don’t hide it. Folks
say CIA’s pulling strings, not fun to cross.</em> I fluttered my lashes,
<em>Crazy! Thanks, sweetie</em>, and slipped him a ten, pocketing the
shot for later.</p>
<p>Mia worked a vendor across the street, hips swaying, chatting up a
guy with a gold tooth hawking fake Rolexes. She came back, whispering,
<em>He says Los Verdugos run a lab nearby, some implants or prostetics
stuff, not just trafficking. Ruiz was in deep.</em> My charm bracelet
jingled as I nodded, piecing it together, cartel masking CIA, high-tech
weirdness, Ruiz’s blood on their hands. We were onto something big, but
the town’s eyes lingered too long, suspicion curling in the air.</p>
<p>Two cops swaggered up, uniforms stained, badges dull, reeking of lust
and power. The taller one, a gut spilling over his belt, grinned sleazy.
<em>Ladies, you’re too fine for this dump. Come with us.</em> I flashed
a coy smile, stalling. <em>Aw, we’re just passing through,
officers.</em> Mia stepped closer, voice sweet. <em>No trouble
here.</em> But the shorter one, wiry with a twitchy eye, grabbed my arm,
grip bruising. <em>Not asking, muñeca.</em> Panic spiked, my girly mask
slipping, and I yanked free, stumbling back. <em>Run!</em> Mia hissed,
and we bolted.</p>
<p>Streets blurred, rapid, wild. Alley slammed narrow, walls scraped my
arms, laundry flapped overhead, wet and heavy. Loudspeaker crackled, a
voice booming in Spanish, <em>All units, two females, detain now!</em>
Heart pounded, sandals slapped dirt, breath burned. Gunshot popped,
loud, close, bullet pinged off a wall, shards stung my cheek.
<em>Faster!</em> Mia yelled, ducking under a low beam. We darted between
shacks, tin roofs rattled, dogs barked mad, a vendor’s cart crashed as
we shoved past, fruit spilling red and yellow.</p>
<p>Twist right, alley tighter, shadows swallowed us, trash stench choked
my nose. Footsteps thundered behind, shouts, <em>There!</em> Hide quick,
ducked behind a rusted dumpster, metal cold, breath held, chest
screamed. Cops barged past, boots loud, cursing, then faded. Peeked out,
alley empty, but loudspeaker droned on, <em>Search west, don’t lose
them!</em> Mia grabbed my hand, pulled me up, we slipped through a gap,
adobe crumbling, into a backstreet, quiet, dark.</p>
<p>Hearts hammered, we crouched low, crept along, buildings loomed,
jagged silhouettes against the sky. Gunshot cracked again, distant now,
warning shot or miss, couldn’t tell. Narrow escape, too close, legs
shook, but we made it, shadows our shield. Mia’s qipao hung torn, my
dress ripped higher, charm bracelet snagged but still on. <em>CIA
lab</em>, I panted, <em>that’s our next hit.</em> Mia nodded, fierce.
<em>Let’s move before they circle back.</em></p>
<h2 id="night-dive-for-access">Night Dive for Access</h2>
<p>The bar hunched on the edge of town, a squat dive spilling neon and
cigarette haze into the night. Mia and I slipped in, my sage-green dress
swapped for a dark hoodie, her qipao traded for a black tank top—low
profiles after the chase. The CIA lab loomed a mile off, a concrete
beast under floodlights, and we needed intel. I perched at a sticky
table, nursing a soda, while Mia leaned against the bar, ear cocked to a
knot of roughnecks griping over beers. My charm bracelet stayed tucked
under my sleeve, glinting faint as I strained to hear.</p>
<p>A barrel-chested guy with a buzzcut growled, <em>Lab’s locked tight.
Test subjects go in back, personnel up front, keycards and scans.</em>
His buddy, wiry with a snake tat, nodded. <em>Delivery checkpoint’s a
bitch. DNA, prints, whole deal.</em> Then a military type, olive drab
jacket stiff, slammed his glass down. <em>Above my pay grade to even
know what’s cooking in there. Cyborg shit, maybe. Creepy as hell.</em>
Mia’s eyes flicked to me, sharp, and I nodded, heart ticking faster. We
had Ruiz’s keycard from his shack, but the checkpoint needed more.</p>
<p>Back at our stolen car, parked in shadows, we hashed it out. <em>Mia,
you can poses as a test subject</em>, I said, voice low, tracing the
keycard’s edge with my thumb. <em>I play lab worker with this. But we
need a body for DNA and finger prints, to pass delivery.</em> Mia’s jaw
set, pragmatic. <em>Sunken ship they mentioned. Trafficked bodies down
there. We dive, grab one.</em> I swallowed, dread curling cold in my
chest. <em>Night dive? In that water?</em> She nodded. <em>Rent a
spearfishing boat, gear up. It’s our shot.</em> My stomach twisted, but
the lab’s secrets loomed too big to dodge.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="a-fragile-barrier">A fragile barrier</h4>
<p>We hit a dockside shack, cash from the cartel stash buying us a
beat-up boat for the night, diving gear, spearguns, a rusty motor
coughing to life. The sea stretched black under a sliver moon, waves
slapping the hull as we motored out. Mia steered, steady, while I zipped
into a wetsuit, the rubber cold and tight, my curls pinned back. The
sunken container’s coordinates were easy to find thanks to the police
buoy, floating above it, with dozen souls lost to the deep, now our key.
I gripped the boat’s edge, water lapping dark, and dropped in, mask
fogging with my shaky breath.</p>
<p>My body sank slow, water pressed cold, shadows swallowed me whole.
Flashlight cut thin, murk swirled thick, pressure squeezed my skull.
Container loomed below, a rusted hulk twisted in the sand, jagged holes
gaping like mouths. Heart thudded, loud in my ears, dread clawed up my
spine. Swim down, legs kicked weak, bubbles trailed, chest tightened.
Peeked inside—bodies drifted, pale, bloated, tangled in chains, eyes
blank. Panic spiked, air thinned, I flailed, <em>Gotta get out, can’t do
this!</em> Surfaced fast, gasping, clinging to the boat, <em>Mia, I
can’t, it’s too much!</em></p>
<p>Mia knelt on the deck, her eyes fierce through the boat’s dim lantern
glow. <em>You can. We need this.</em> I shook my head, wet curls
slapping my cheeks, dread pooling heavy, drowning me in shivers. Water
lapped the hull, black and endless, mocking my gasps. Then I spotted it,
a dented canister of technical alcohol stashed by the gear, its sharp,
chemical reek cutting through the salt air. Maybe white male can dive
better than me, a dark whisper promising calm where I had none.
<em>Gimme that</em>, I rasped, voice raw, snatching it with trembling
hands. Lid twisted off, fumes hit like a punch, acrid, stinging my nose,
bitter promise of escape. Tipped it back, liquid sloshed, burned my
lips, scorched my throat raw, a vile mix of gasoline and rot. Gagged
hard, stomach heaved, spit dribbled, but I forced it down, three gulps,
enough, just enough, tears pricked, mouth numb, then snap, WMD locked
in, cold, hard, alive.</p>
<p>Mask secured, fins strapped on, I plunged into the void, a plunge
that felt less like a dive and more like a deliberate step into a cosmic
dream. The lingering sting of alcohol blurred the edges of my paranoia
into a disorienting clarity, turning the underwater world into a canvas
of surreal neon fragments and endless darkness.</p>
<p>I descended slowly, each movement deliberate, as if I were wading
through the ether of an alternate universe. The dive suit clung to me
like a second skin, a fragile barrier against the infinite. My
flashlight sliced through the murk, scattering motes of silt like tiny,
rebellious stars flitting across an alien sky.</p>
<p>Beneath the swirling cosmic ballet, the ocean floor emerged, a relic
from a bygone era. There it lay: a twisted, rusted container exhaling
secrets into the blackness, a silent promise of the body I was meant to
reclaim. Every kick, every subtle adjustment was synchronized with the
rhythm of the deep, a heartbeat shared between the ancient sea and the
vast, uncanny universe surrounding me.</p>
<p>In this liquid cosmos, the absurdity of my state struck hard: here I
was, intoxicated into a lucid, almost spiritual clarity, navigating a
universe that pulsed with life and mystery, yet anchored by the grim
reality of a human husk. The usual buzz of paranoid thoughts had given
way to an unsettling tranquility, a moment where I was both hunter and
wanderer in an endless, star-strewn abyss.</p>
<p>Bodies drifted, pale husks swaying gentle in the currents, chains
clinking soft, a murmur against the deep’s hum. Catalog kicked in, eyes
swept slow: male, mid-30s, skin taut but mottled, fingers curled intact,
DNA ripe. <code>DEPTH—CALM—GRAB—DNA—NOW—</code> purred in my skull, a
quiet chant, no scream, just purpose. Chain brittle, flakes floated
free, snapped it with a tug, faint crack rippled, grabbed his wrist,
cold slime slick under my grip, flesh soft like damp earth. Pulled
smooth, he drifted loose, weightless in my hold, bubbles rose slow,
silver threads weaving up, catching light, glinting gold. Surface
beckoned, kicked steady, lungs stretched easy, broke water smooth,
hauled him aboard, wet thud on deck, water pooled dark beneath him.</p>
<p>Mia stares, lantern casting shadows on her wide eyes. <em>You did
it.</em> I pant, still as WMD, but he calmed by sea, a soft fade, not a
crash. <em>Yeah. Prints, DNA, he’s our pass.</em> She nods, tossing me a
towel, rough weave scratches my arms. Then fresh clothes, jeans stiff,
tee soft, hers too. We strip the wetsuits, rubber peels slow, shivering
fades as denim hugs my legs, cotton settles on my shoulders. The body
sprawls between us, pale under the moon, a grim ticket to the lab. Boat
hums back to shore, motor’s drone blends with the waves, night thickens,
my skin prickles, but we’ve got what we need.</p>
<h2 id="stung-my-eyes">Stung My Eyes</h2>
<p>The lab squatted under the morning sky, a hulking fortress of
concrete and steel, its floodlights pale against the dawn streaking over
the scrubland. Mia and I crept closer, my fresh jeans scuffing the dirt,
her tee clinging tight as we clutched the dead man’s prints, our grim
key. My charm bracelet jingled soft under my sleeve, a tiny sun pendant
catching the light like a promise I wasn’t sure we could keep. We’d gone
from Instagram vibes to spy-movie stakes, and my heart fluttered like a
butterfly riding a breeze. Mia’s eyes gleamed fierce, whispering,
<em>You ready, babe?</em> I nodded, swallowing hard. <em>Let’s do
this.</em></p>
<p>The checkpoint loomed, a steel gate flanked by scanners, cold and
unblinking. Mia posed as the test subject, her stance stiff, while I
flashed Ruiz’s keycard, its edges worn from his shack. The guard, a slab
of muscle with a buzzcut, grunted, <em>Prints.</em> I pressed the
corpse’s cold fingers to the pad, breath held, praying the saltwater
hadn’t ruined them. Green light blinked, gate hissed open, and we
slipped inside, my pulse racing like a club beat. The booze from last
night had cleared out, leaving me steady, Lila again, no wild drunken
shadow lurking. Girly me had to charm this through.</p>
<p>Concrete tunnels stretched ahead, gray and endless, walls humming
with the low buzz of servers stacked behind grates. Air stung cold,
sterile, like a hospital gone rogue, and my sneakers squeaked on the
polished floor, too loud in the quiet. Mia nudged me toward a side
corridor, whispering, <em>Secret wing’s gotta be deep.</em> We moved
slow, shadows stretching long, my hoodie’s hood up, Mia’s dark hair a
sleek slash against the dim. A whiteboard caught my eye—scrawled note in
sharpie: <em>Too much security issues. Project under higher-up control
till personal motivation issues resolved.</em> I frowned, muttering,
<em>I can guess who are this security issues.</em> Mia nodded, scanning
the board, <em>Looks like they’re on edge.</em></p>
<p>Voices drifted from a break room as we crept past—two techs in lab
coats, coffee cups steaming. <em>They’re pushing the upload tech
hard</em>, one grumbled, voice low. <em>Ruiz screwed us, tried selling
it out.</em> The other sighed, <em>Yeah, security’s a mess now.</em> My
stomach flipped; Ruiz, selling out? We pressed on, the tunnel twisting
deeper, lights flickering like a bad vibe I couldn’t shake.</p>
<p>A locked door gleamed ahead, steel slab with a print scanner. I
swiped the keycard, pressed the dead man’s prints again, and it clicked
open, revealing a secret wing, rows of humming laptops, papers strewn
chaotic, a sterile glow bathing it all. My girly instincts kicked in,
soaking up the details like a mood board gone dark. Found one unlocked
laptop, email was not logged off, what a luck, top message marked as
urgent:
<code>Dr. Ruiz - terminated. Part of AI mind-upload project, attempted sale to Chinese intelligence. Project will be moved to the new management.</code>
I gasped, soft, <em>He was playing double agent?</em> Mia nodded,
scanning the screen, <em>Looks like it got him killed.</em></p>
<p>A table nearby held a printed paper, creased and smudged—headline
screamed: <em>VR Construct Leak: Whistleblower’s Gambit? Security
Protocols Tightened.</em> My eyes widened, fingers brushing the page.
<em>The trial... someone blew it open?</em> Mia’s voice hardened,
<em>Explains the heat on us.</em> We dug further, finding project files,
charts, code, tech jargon sprawling like a sci-fi novel I couldn’t
decode. <em>This is nuts</em>, I muttered, flipping through, <em>Too
complicated to even look at.</em> Mia grabbed a flash drive from a desk,
plugged it in, copied what she could. <em>We’ll figure it later. Take
this.</em></p>
<p>A piercing alarm shredded the silence, crimson lights throbbing like
a heartbeat, a cold computer voice droning, <em>Remain in place.
Security inbound</em>. My heart leapt into my throat, <em>What’d we
do?</em> Mia yanked the drive free, eyes wide. <em>Access triggered it.
move!</em> Footsteps pounded, voices barked orders down the tunnels,
<em>Intruders in Wing C, lock it down!</em> We bolted, but the corridor
split, left to the exit, right to nowhere. Mia grabbed my wrist,
<em>Medical wing, hide there!</em> We veered right, sneakers skidding,
into a dim hall reeking of antiseptic and rot.</p>
<p>The medical wing gaped ahead, steel tables gleaming under flickering
lights, a wall of glass chambers fogged with frost. Then I saw it, a
pile of discarded bodies in a corner, pale limbs tangled, flesh mottled
blue and gray, some stitched rough, others too perfect, eyes wide and
blank. Failed experiments? Or too successful, gone wrong? My stomach
churned, girly charm cracking as I gagged, <em>No way, Mia!</em> She
shoved me forward, fierce, <em>Under them, now!</em> We dove in,
squirming beneath the heap, cold skin pressing against my back, a clammy
hand brushing my cheek. I bit my lip hard, stifling a scream, charm
bracelet snagging on a corpse’s torn sleeve.</p>
<p>Boots stomped close, agents in black swept the room, radios
crackling, <em>Check every corner, they’re here somewhere!</em> A
flashlight beam sliced over the pile, my breath froze, Mia’s hand
squeezed mine under the mess, nails digging in. Bodies shifted, heavy,
wet, a low groan slipped from one, was it alive? My pulse hammered,
sweat stung my eyes, but I stayed still, a mannequin in a graveyard of
flesh. <em>Clear, Nobody there.</em>, an agent grunted, boots
retreating, <em>Search the east wing.</em> Silence crept back, broken
only by the hum of machines and my ragged breaths.</p>
<p>We crawled out slow, peeling free, my jeans smeared with something
dark, Mia’s tee ripped at the shoulder. I shook, brushing off the chill,
<em>That was too close.</em> Mia nodded, clutching the flash drive,
<em>But we’ve got it.</em> My girly veneer was frayed, but the spy-movie
thrill held, Ruiz betrayed, minds uploaded, and us, still breathing
under the dead.</p>
<p>Footsteps echoed, sharp and close. I froze, heart tripping, as two
figures passed a glass wall, narrow eyes, polishing glasses, all The
Jew, same squint, same eerie calm. <em>Two of him? Where’s the
third?</em> I hissed, clutching Mia’s arm. Clones or hallucination, my
liquor-soaked brain couldn’t tell, but his presence chilled me like a
bad filter on a perfect shot. Mia pulled me back, <em>No confrontation.
We move.</em> We ducked low, slipping past server racks, their hum
masking our steps.</p>
<p>Tension coiled tight, my girly charm stretched thin, but we’d snagged
the truth: Ruiz’s betrayal, mind-uploading tech, a whistleblower’s VR
trial sparking this mess. The flash drive weighed heavy in my pocket, a
glittering prize in this conspiracy nightmare. We’d seen The Jew, dodged
him, and now we had to get out before the lab’s secrets swallowed us
whole.</p>
<h2 id="green-flash-safe">Green Flash, Safe</h2>
<p>The medical lab was a sterile trap, steel walls, glass panels,
machines humming like a tightening noose. Corpses slumped in corners,
skin mottled blue and gray, eyes blank or twitching, failed experiments
or twisted successes, who cared? Boots echoed down concrete halls;
security was closing in. My breath fogged the frigid air, sharp and
fast. Mia’s gaze sliced the room, landing on a shelf: a bottle,
<em>Ethanol, Medical Grade</em>, glinting under harsh light. She
grinned, wicked. <em>Drink it, Lila. Wake him up.</em></p>
<p>I hesitated, stomach lurching. <em>You’re kidding.</em> She stepped
in, voice a hiss. <em>WMD’s our ticket out.</em> I had a small sip. Then
she grabbed me, kissed, hard, fierce, a clash of salt and desperation.
Pulled back smirking. <em>For luck. And I’ve always wanted to kiss a
drunk.</em> I snorted, unsteady, holding the bottle. Fumes hit like a
slap—sharp, chemical. I tipped it back, liquid fire seared my throat,
gagged me, but I forced it down. Heat erupted, then—snap—WMD surged
awake, cold and ruthless. My hand pulled Mia closer, eyes locked, my
lips sink into hers, she wants it too, <code>KISS—LUCK—DRUNK—</code>
screamed in my skull <code>PLAN—NOW—</code>.</p>
<p>We burst through a half-open door into the dim office annex of the
medical lab, computers humming low, screens flickering with ghostly blue
light across the walls. He sat alone, the Jew, hunched over a keyboard,
fingers dancing in a blur. Too focused. Too vulnerable. Or so I thought.
WMD surged in me, primal, unstoppable. I snatched a scalpel from a tray,
its edge glinting like a shard of ice, and lunged. Aimed for the throat,
fast, clean. But the blade hit resistance, sparked off a sheen of metal
beneath his skin. <code>WHAT THE?—CYBORG—ROBOT—</code>. Reinforced
subdermal plating, for sure.</p>
<p>He whirled, eyes glowing faint amber, a mechanical snarl ripping from
his throat. <em>You stupid bitch</em> His arm shot out, augmented,
piston-fast, backhanding me across the room. I crashed into a desk,
papers exploding like doves in a storm, pain blooming in my jaw. Mia
froze, planing next action, breath hitching. He advanced, servos
whining, a predator’s grin splitting his face. Scalpel was useless, his
neck was a fortress. Mia’s eyes locked on a surgeon’s saw, its jagged
teeth winking under the fluorescent haze.</p>
<p>I rolled, dodging a hydraulic stomp that cratered the floor, Mia
throwed the saw just in time. He lunged, too slow. I swung, full force,
a wild arc of desperation. The blade screamed against his chest plate,
sparks raining, then bit into a seam, flesh and circuits parting in a
wet, grinding tear. Blood sprayed, hot and coppery, mixing with oil,
soaking my arms. He roared, <em>You—fucking—!</em> - clawing at me with
a hand that whirred and clicked. I drove the saw deeper, ribs snapping
like dry twigs, synthetic muscle shredding. His eyes flared, then
dimmed, amber fading to black. One last hack, neck half-severed, wires
dangling, and he staggered, a marionette with cut strings, collapsing in
a pool of red and black.</p>
<p>Mia’s gasp sliced the air, but I was ice, unyielding.
<em>Freezer</em>. I grabbed his twitching corpse, dragging it across the
tiles, smearing crimson and grease, then heaved him into the cold steel
box. The door slammed shut with a clang that echoed like a gunshot.
<em>JEW—DEAD—</em> roared in my skull, a triumph carved in blood and
silence.</p>
<p>His keycard conviniently dangled out of freezer, took it, wiped blood
on my jeans. <em>His office. Now.</em> We ran, alarms piercing, boots
pounding closer. Slid the card, <em>hiss</em>, door parted. Plush
office, mahogany desk, screens flickering. A retinal scanner blinked by
a safe. <em>Eye. Need it.</em> Mia balked. <em>Lila—</em> <em>No
choice.</em> Back to the freezer, pried it open, body stiffening.
Scalpel out, carved his socket, wet pop, gore oozed, eye free.
<code>EYE—OUT—NOW—</code> blared. Raced back, pressed it to the scanner,
green flash, safe unlocked.</p>
<p>Inside: a laptop. Powered it on, Mia tense beside me. Screen lit up,
database, profiles. Search for developers who might be related to VR
trial.
<code>Developer: Makr Globach, statistic signal recovery, last project VR Persona Construct</code>.
I read more.
<code>White male. Desided to went whistleblower to expose CIA project, Uploaded himself, technology still destrictive for a subject, orginize delivery to his favorite Instagram model. Project risk unknown, Recomending to assign an agent to monitor what happens with girl after she tried VR. Upload still imperfect, VR simulation of a person has all memories to mixed up.</code>
A line mocked. His mind lived in me, fractured, screaming. My heart
slammed. <em>That’s why I’m WMD.</em> Mia gripped me. <em>We’ll fix
it.</em></p>
<p>Alarms spiked—boots too close. <em>Move!</em> Laptop tucked underarm,
Mia pointed, a ladder in the corner. <em>Rooftop!</em> We climbed, rungs
slick, hands trembling, WMD fading. Burst out, outside air stung, below
on court in a middle of the lab all flooded with armed security
personel. Low flying helicopters, comming from mountains at the north. A
low hum cut through, a white flying car, dropped fast, door open. <em>no
pilot, autopiloted?</em> No time, leaped in, Mia beside me. It shot
upward, banking hard as helicopters swarmed, rotors thumped, gunfire
popped, guards shooting below. City streaked by, my breath caught.
<em>Who’s flying this?</em> Mia whispered. No answer, just the hum,
chaos fading, and us, dangling on the edge of survival.</p>
